      "buldaar": {
         "Description": "The very landlocked town of Buldaar is home to a large concentrated dwarven community. The outskirts of the town, and the road leading up to it, are quite hilly and rocky, which is unusual due to the flat landscape present across the rest of the Crinegard Plains.\nThere is always work available in the mines if you're looking for a job. A rich sense of community is found in the Collarglaive, a suburb where the mines are located. A temple worshiping Moradin is located in the Collarglaive, and is very popular to many.",
         "Demographics": "40% dwarves, 23% halflings, 19% human, 13% gnomes, 3% elves, 2% other races",
         "Government": "There is a small barracks established near the southern entrance, where Starrgard monitor the town. Other than this, there are no set individuals that look over the town.",
         "Defences": "The large rocks that surround the town cause for a tricky, and curvy path up to the main gates. Forts are located along these paths, and are hidden among the stonework, making it tricky to traverse without being spotted. Steel gates can be shut at the town entrance, making it near impossible to conquer from these routes. There is probably no safer place to be in the Crinegard Plains.",
         "Industry": "The Collarglaive are home to many miners of Buldaar, who work to gather coal and ore for their own use, and export throughout the kingdom.",
         "Collarglaive": "In the north-eastern parts of Buldaar is the Collarglaive, a smaller village where a lot dwarves and miners live. Around 2,800 humanoids live here, and most tend to not explore the rest of Buldaar, the dwarves believing in strength among themselves. Everything they need is here, their homes, work, and a bustling tavern.",
         "The Mines": "Buldaar became a successful settlement due to the abundance of strategic resources, including coal and ore. Some also say that there is a source of adamantine in the mines. There are half a dozen mines scattered through the Collarglaive that are predominalty dwarf-worked. The mines are overlooked by a branch of the Trade Guild, ultimately run by the Crown, who keep track of the ores and materials coming out of the mines. There resources are divvied up first to the Crown, and any resources are then sole to blacksmiths and jewellers. Some miners hide rarer gems that they discover, and there are random checks run that encourage those not to steal from the Crown's rightful materials.",
         "The Drunken Ratt": "Located just off of the central town square, this tavern sees some regular business over the working week, but does not get too busy. It has a well lit interior, with the walls and floor being made up of cobblestone. Three evenly-spaced torches appear on the wall opposite the war, with two torches also placed on the wall behind it. Above the door there is an iron shield with dwarven runes inscribed into it, with the familiar red and gold colouring of the Crinegard Plains appearing on the edges of it.",
         "Ye Old Gofer": "This is found in the dwarven village of the Collarglaive. It sees a lot of clientel, particularly at the end of the working week, where predominantly dwarves go to drink away their hard-earned money from working in the mines. Drinks are brought to you upon sitting down at an empty table. It has an open interior. No door and no roof. It has dark, stained wooden floors and low-seating tables. You would not see a bar if you were to look around, and very brief encounters with workers only occur when you are given your drinks.",
         "The Barracks": "The main barracks are found by the south entrance of town, down the rocky ramp that decends from the tall gate. It is a simple one-story building made of stone bricks. The commander of the Starrgard has an office to the left of the reception. Commander Durik was a male dwarf who ran the Starrgard in Buldaar. He was a shorter dwarf with long dark hair. The Starrgard are 50% human, 30% dwarf, and 20% elf outside of the Collarglaive. Inside, they are 80% dwarf, and 20% human.",
         "Greybrew's": "A family run potion store that opened 200 years ago. It has profitted greatly from selling unique and reliable potions to the Crown, and to the odd adventurer who finds their way to Buldaar. Greybrew was the nickname they were given by a rival famliy when the shop first opened, and they took it on as a joke. It is run by Tulbar Greybrew.",
         "Iron Buckle": "A short ginger-haired man by the name of Nozmak is the guy to go to forge anything. He has plenty of items available, and also some finer ones for a higher price.",
         "Gyer's Jewellers": "A gems store and jewellery just north up the road from the central square. Jeffery Gyer runs the joint.",
         "Temple of Moradin": "The Allhammer has been very prominent throughout the Crinegard Plains for centuries, and his central temple is found in the heart of the Collarglaive, at its lowest point, making it easy to spot. Moradin represents loyalty and legacy, and are worshipped by smiths and artisans, as he guides them in the forging of great creations. The silver designs on the items forged match the designs of the clerics and paladins that follow Moradin, and can be seen wandering around the Collarglaive, Buldaar, and even outside the Crinegard Plains.",
         "The Argent Axes": "A guild responsible for the upkeep of the mines and monitoring of the rocky peaks surrounding Buldaar, members of the Argent Axes are trained warriors that are experienced in fighting beasts and anything else that dare to disrupt the secluded way of life on the mountain tops.",
         "Architecture": "The rocky landscape means you hardly find yourself in a flat surface across the town. Very up and down throughout every street. Some buildings are built into a stone wall, while others extend across a dip in the rocks.",
         "Natural Resources": "Coal, ore, some say there are traces of adamantine in the mines."

         "The Docks": "Travellers from other empires embark and disembark at the main port in Trimor, which is located at the south end of Creswell. Imports and exports are also processed here, making it a perfect location for the Trade Guild. The Creswell Commercial Port (or the Tipsy Sea Serpent) is where people can buy recently shipped in wares. It is a complex set of buildings, connected by many air bridges. Just off to the east of the Commercial Port, are the Tormund Fighting Pits, where tri-weekly tournaments are hosted.",
         "Cliffven": "The slums of Creswell are the area just south to the entrance to the Inner Ring. A lot of workers in the fields and docks reside here, and a market is set up daily to sell pelts, meats and fish, and homemade trinkets.",

Emilia is a barmaid at the Tipsy Keg. She is a tall human with long, red, braided hair, and light blue eyes. Kolvar is a dwarven cook. Relatively tall for a dwarf, he talks in a scruffy Scottish accent. He has tied back brown hair, and is quite messy and sweaty.",

         "Current Date": "Leoreen, the 12th day of Fenlar, 3E-286",
         "The Start of the Third Era": "The Kingdom of Trimor formed nearly three centuries ago, to unite against the fiends that tore through the a rip in the plains. These fiends devastated the Material Plain, destroying barracks, burning fields, and slaying all those who dared cross them. These independent republics that are now united under Trimor, came together for the first time to destroy this evil. The Crimson Malitia were formed under this, then temporary concord, and successfully drove back the fiend army attack over this part of Greyspire over the course of six years. Battle sites are scattered across the plains, and rift openings hidden, and seemingly lost in history. It is not known the underlying reason to their attack, but it ultimately brought a lot of people together. After the battle was finally won, the republics came together and united, ultimately forming under the monarchy of Norlock Starr. The now region of the Starr Grounds had the most resources and largest population, giving it the greatest claim to running the kingdom. The monarchy supports the kingdom as a whole, but each region has a designated capital that oversees the needs for their specific people.",
         "Calendar of Greyspire": "The calendar that is followed across most of the world has 281 days. It is grouped into ten months, and followed through seven day weeks. It has deep elven ancestry, which is visible for the names of the months and days that still represent this calendar these many centuries later. The holidays however, are mainly representative of the days celebrated by all those in Trimor. The days of the week are Dafaren, Raloren, Dormren, Brytren, Yesren, Safareen, and Leoreen.",
         "Starr Grounds": "The home of the capital Billingwood and the monarchy, the Starr Grounds are regarded as the central hub of the kingdom. Highly populous, the Starr Grounds are home to a mixture of races. Originally dominantly human before Trimor was formed, its indigenous culture is relatively no longer present as large groups of other races are scattered across through the townships. The Culderwoods take up a large area of this region, and have been relatively untouched due to how dense it is.",
         "Astesh": "The southern-most region of the western divide, Ashtesh is the gateway east across the peaks of Highgate. A contender for the first settlement of Trimor is Felderwind, where a large amount of lumber and exotic fruits are harvested. The capital Highgate, maintains the flow of people through the divide. A city built into the mountains, dwarvish heritage is rich here.",
         "Oadraar": "The region with a view of the Dire Alps to the north-west, it is the last line before the empire of Farwind. The snowy township of Alldene is a common stop for adventurers before setting foot outside of the kingdom. The western-most settlement of Trimor is the costal city of Zadaar. The region capital is located among a hilly range, and home of the Arcane Conglomerate.",
         "Crinegard Plains": "The beautiful plains of Crinegard are home to the people of the second-most populous region. Originally from dwarven heritage, their culture is interwoven in most settlements throughout the area. Creswell is the region capital and home to the main port and the trade guild. Wanderers travel to Fleydire for a holiday retreat, with many eateries for exotic foods, and a view of the Malva Coast is appetising for most.",
         "Saifra": "Many large costal settlements are found throughout Saifra, with a lot of produce and vegetables being imported from neighbouring regions. However for what this region lacks in farming, it makes up for in mining and engineering. The mines located next to the north-west of its capital Darrington are worked for their coal and ore for production of weapons, armour, and other experimental contraptions.",
         "Endrais": "The hotter climate up the northern end of the eastern reaches makes Endrais one of the lesser inhabited regions of Trimor. The fewer established settlement often accounts for less travel to the region. Monfield has a view over the southern reaches of the Spiked Gate, a haven for shipwrecks if traversed without care. Many ships dock here before a journey through the Cobalt Sound. To the north is the abandoned city of Endes, a settlement that suffered the brunt of the fiend attack. Some say dessert creatures wander the ruins, but others have come back with vast amounts of treasures.",
         "Luria": "The people of Luria, a republic to the south-west, decided to keep their people separate to Trimor after the army of fiends were defeated. They helped keep them at bay during this war, and remain a close ally to this day. Some people travel to Luria for the beautiful sights, while some seek a greater meaning, making a trek to Elder Reach to rediscover themselves.",
         "Farwind": "Across Alldene Pass to the north-west is the plutocracy of Farwind. They are not considered an ally of Trimor, but have a few trade routes stemming through the pass, and along the seas. They had their own dealings with the army of fiends, and kept to themselves during this stressful period.",
         "Pantheons & Deities": "Although there aren't any formally recognised deities in Trimor, there are some more prominent than others. You can find temples to recognised gods and goddesses at most cities and towns, and priests spread the word of their holiness on the streets.",
         "Grindwall Record": "The people who work at The Grindwall Record are the primary keepers of information and specialists in specific research. The formal attire follows the deep purple monarch colour, with different embroidery designs representing the status of its members. There are libraries at every region capital, but the main headquarters are located in Billingwood.",
         "Crimson Malitia": "Formed near the end of the second era, the Crimson Malitia remain the first line of defence across Trimor against other intruders, and are stationed at multiple towns and cities across the kingdom. They can be recognised from the engraved armour, with different colours representing their rank and division.",
         "Starrgard": "Guards patrolling the streets and officers keeping law and order in major and minor settlements are classified as Starrgard, employed directly by the crown, but work on behalf of their regions. Even villages as small as fifty people will have some Starrgard keeping an eye on the peace.",
         "Acrane Conglomerate": "The study and research of magic predominantly takes place at the Arcane Conglomerate. From teaching the arcane practice, to researching new methods of manipulation of matter and energy, this school located in Zadaar is some people's dreams to attend.",
         "Trade Guild": "The Trade Guild is responsible for the moving traffic of goods across the roads and seas of Trimor. The guild is centred in Creswell, as the city is the main port of the kingdom. It is responsible for the imports and exports to and from other empires in Greyspire."
