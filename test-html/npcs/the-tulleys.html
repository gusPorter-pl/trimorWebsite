            The Tulleys are the two humans who run the enchanters shop Tulley's & Tulley's in 
            <span class="link"><a href="../settlements/creswell.html">Creswell</a></span>. They are looking to branch out to other regions if business takes a hold.

         <h3>Aldom Tulley</h3>
         <p>
            The eldest of the two brothers. Has straight, longish, dark hair. Prominent voice that can be heard over others. Gives Dyron a bit of a rough time. Is in charge of the business side of things at the shop.
         </p>
         <h3>Dyron Tulley</h3>
         <p>
            Curly, short, dark hair. He has a nervous voice, almost like Tweek. He focusses on the enchantment of items, but was the brother who the party met on their first visit to the store.
         </p>
         <p>
            Dyron asked the party to retrieve a battle-axe that belonged to the family. It was supposedly stolen from the store one night, and Dyron thinks he knew who did it. He gave the party a description of a house in the Outer Ring where he believes the battle-axe is.
