         <p>
            The very landlocked town of Buldaar is home to a large concentrated dwarven community. The outskirts of the town, and the road leading up to it, are quite hilly and rocky, which is unusual due to the flat landscape present across the rest of the Crinegard Plains.
         </p>
         <p>
            There is always work available in the mines if you're looking for a job. A rich sense of community is found in the Collarglaive, a suburb where the mines are located. A temple worshiping Moradin is located in the Collarglaive, and is very popular to many.
         </p>
         <h3>Demographics</h3>
         <p>
            40% dwarves, 23% halflings, 19% human, 13% gnomes, 3% elves, 2% other races
         </p>
         <h3>Government</h3>
         <p>
            There is a small barracks established near the southern entrance, where Starrgard monitor the town. Other than this, there are no set individuals that look over the town.
         </p>
         <h3>Defences</h3>
         <p>
            The large rocks that surround the town cause for a tricky, and curvy path up to the main gates. Forts are located along these paths, and are hidden among the stonework, making it tricky to traverse without being spotted. Steel gates can be shut at the town entrance, making it near impossible to conquer from these routes. There is probably no safer place to be in the Crinegard Plains.
         </p>
         <h3>Industry</h3>
         <p>
            The Collarglaive are home to many miners of Buldaar, who work to gather coal and ore for their own use, and export throughout the kingdom.
         </p>
         <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
         <h4>Collarglaive</h4>
         <p>
            In the north-eastern parts of Buldaar is the Collarglaive, a smaller village where a lot dwarves and miners live. Around 2,800 humanoids live here, and most tend to not explore the rest of Buldaar, the dwarves believing in strength among themselves. Everything they need is here, their homes, work, and a bustling tavern.
         </p>
         <h4>The Mines</h4>
         <p>
            Buldaar became a successful settlement due to the abundance of strategic resources, including coal and ore. Some also say that there is a source of adamantine in the mines. There are half a dozen mines scattered through the Collarglaive that are predominalty dwarf-worked. The mines are overlooked by a branch of the Trade Guild, ultimately run by the Crown, who keep track of the ores and materials coming out of the mines. There resources are divvied up first to the Crown, and any resources are then sole to blacksmiths and jewellers. Some miners hide rarer gems that they discover, and there are random checks run that encourage those not to steal from the Crown's rightful materials.
         </p>
         <h3>Inns, Shops, and Buildings</h3>
         <h4>The Drunken Ratt</h4>
         <p>
            Located just off of the central town square, this tavern sees some regular business over the working week, but does not get too busy. It has a well lit interior, with the walls and floor being made up of cobblestone. Three evenly-spaced torches appear on the wall opposite the war, with two torches also placed on the wall behind it. Above the door there is an iron shield with dwarven runes inscribed into it, with the familiar red and gold colouring of the Crinegard Plains appearing on the edges of it.
         </p>
         <h4>Ye Old Gofer</h4>
         <p>
            This is found in the dwarven village of the Collarglaive. It sees a lot of clientel, particularly at the end of the working week, where predominantly dwarves go to drink away their hard-earned money from working in the mines. Drinks are brought to you upon sitting down at an empty table. It has an open interior. No door and no roof. It has dark, stained wooden floors and low-seating tables. You would not see a bar if you were to look around, and very brief encounters with workers only occur when you are given your drinks.
         </p>
         <h4>The Barracks</h4>
         <p>
            The main barracks are found by the south entrance of town, down the rocky ramp that decends from the tall gate. It is a simple one-story building made of stone bricks. The commander of the Starrgard has an office to the left of the reception. Commander Durik was a male dwarf who ran the Starrgard in Buldaar. He was a shorter dwarf with long dark hair. The Starrgard are 50% human, 30% dwarf, and 20% elf outside of the Collarglaive. Inside, they are 80% dwarf, and 20% human.
         </p>
         <h4>Greybrew's</h4>
         <p>
            A family run potion store that opened 200 years ago. It has profitted greatly from selling unique and reliable potions to the Crown, and to the odd adventurer who finds their way to Buldaar. Greybrew was the nickname they were given by a rival famliy when the shop first opened, and they took it on as a joke. It is run by

         </p>
         <h4>Iron Buckle</h4>
         <p>
            A short ginger-haired man by the name of Nozmak is the guy to go to forge anything. He has plenty of items available, and also some finer ones for a higher price.
         </p>
         <h4>Gyer's Jewellers</h4>
         <p>
            A gems store and jewellery just north up the road from the central square. 
            <span class="link"><a href="../npc/jeffery-gyer.html">Jeffery Gyer</a></span> runs the joint.
         </p>
         <h3>Guilds and Factions</h3>
         <h4>Temple of Moradin</h4>
         <p>
            The Allhammer has been very prominent throughout the Crinegard Plains for centuries, and his central temple is found in the heart of the Collarglaive, at its lowest point, making it easy to spot. Moradin represents loyalty and legacy, and are worshipped by smiths and artisans, as he guides them in the forging of great creations. The silver designs on the items forged match the designs of the clerics and paladins that follow Moradin, and can be seen wandering around the Collarglaive, Buldaar, and even outside the Crinegard Plains.
         </p>
         <h4>The Argent Axes</h4>
         <p>
            A guild responsible for the upkeep of the mines and monitoring of the rocky peaks surrounding Buldaar, members of the Argent Axes are trained warriors that are experienced in fighting beasts and anything else that dare to disrupt the secluded way of life on the mountain tops.
         </p>
         <h3>Architecture</h3>
         <p>
            The rocky landscape means you hardly find yourself in a flat surface across the town. Very up and down throughout every street. Some buildings are built into a stone wall, while others extend across a dip in the rocks.
         </p>
         <h3>Natural Resources</h3>
         <p>
            Coal, ore, some say there are traces of adamantine in the mines.
