      <h1>Buldaar</h1>
      <p>
         The very landlocked town of Buldaar is home to a large concentrated dwarven community. The outskirts of the town, and the road leading up to it, are quite hilly and rocky, which is unusual due to the flat landscape present across the rest of the Crinegard Plains.
      </p>
      <p>
         There is always work available in the mines if you're looking for a job. A rich sense of community is found in the Collarglaive, a suburb where the mines are located. A temple worshiping Moradin is located in the Collarglaive, and is very popular to many.
      </p>
      <h3>Demographics</h3>
      <p>
         40% dwarves, 23% halflings, 19% human, 13% gnomes, 3% elves, 2% other races
      </p>
      <h3>Government</h3>
      <p>
         There is a small barracks established near the southern entrance, where Starrgard monitor the town. Other than this, there are no set individuals that look over the town.
      </p>
      <h3>Defences</h3>
      <p>
         The large rocks that surround the town cause for a tricky, and curvy path up to the main gates. Forts are located along these paths, and are hidden among the stonework, making it tricky to traverse without being spotted. Steel gates can be shut at the town entrance, making it near impossible to conquer from these routes. There is probably no safer place to be in the Crinegard Plains.
      </p>
      <h3>Industry</h3>
      <p>
         The Collarglaive are home to many miners of Buldaar, who work to gather coal and ore for their own use, and export throughout the kingdom.
      </p>
      <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
      <p>
         In the north-western parts of Buldaar is the Collarglaive, a smaller village where a lot dwarves and miners live. Around 2,800 humanoids live here, and most tend to not explore the rest of Buldaar, the dwarves believing in strength among themselves.
      </p>
      <h3>Guilds and Factions</h3>
      <h4>Temple of Moradin</h4>
      <p>
         The Allhammer has been very prominent throughout the Crinegard Plains for centuries, and his central temple is found in the heart of the Collarglaive. Moradin represents loyalty and legacy, and are worshipped by smiths and artisans, as he guides them in the forging of great creations.
      </p>
      <h4>The Argent Axes</h4>
      <p>
         A guild responsible for the upkeep of the mines and monitoring of the rocky peaks surrounding Buldaar, members of the Argent Axes are trained warriors that are experienced in fighting beasts and anything else that dare to disrupt the secluded way of life on the mountain tops.
      </p>
      <h3>Architecture</h3>
      <p>
         The rocky landscape means you hardly find yourself in a flat surface across the town. Very up and down throughout every street. Some buildings are built into a stone wall, while others extend across a dip in the rocks.
      </p>
      <h3>Natural Resources</h3>
      <p>
         Coal, ore, some say there are traces of adamantine in the mines.
