      <h1>Creswell</h1>
      <p>
         Located on the south-eastern border, Creswell is the third largest city of Trimor, and is also one of its first settlements. It is the region capital of the Crinegard Plains, and the second-most populous city in the eastern reaches.
      </p>
      <p>
         It is the main port of Trimor to other kingdoms. Goods are shipped into and out of Creswell, as well as travellers. The Trade Guild is established here for convenience, and is located by the docks.
      </p>
      <p>
         The city is divided into six areas/districts:
      </p>
         <ul>
            <li>The Inner Ring</li>
            <li>The Lower Ring</li>
            <li>The Outer Ring</li>
            <li>The Docks</li>
            <li>Cliffven</li>
            <li>Silverhill Village</li>
         </ul>
      <p>
         The three rings are elevated on cliff faces that make up Creswell's unique structure. These are easily visible to people on the docks, from the main streets of Cliffven, and towards the end of the roads that lead to Creswell.
      </p>
      <h3>Demographics</h3>
      <p>
         46% humans, 27% dwarves, 21% halflings, 6% other races
      </p>
      <h3>Government</h3>
      <p>
         The region capital of the Crinegard Plains has an overseeing council for the region, and a smaller group of individuals to monitor the city itself. The regional council keeps an eye on trade and military, while the city council monitors the production of food, the customs at the port, and their division of the Grindwall Record, as well as other things.
      </p>
      <h3>Defences</h3>
      <p>
         Multiple forts keep an eye on the roads into the city, while the outer city wall surrounds 85% of the city's inhabitants.
      </p>
      <h3>Industry</h3>
      <p>
         There are farms on the outskirts of the city, providing wheat and grain, and also meats. Enough is produced for the inhabitants of Creswell, and is exported across the Crinegard Plains. There are also fisheries a few kilometres south in a small settlement called Silverhill Village. Creswell is also home to the Tormund Fighting Pits, which hosts a tri-weekly event showing off terrific beasts fighting each other.
      </p>
      <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
      <h4>The Lower Ring</h4>
      <p>
         The Lower Ring is the first ring structure that you reach after ascending the stairs from Cliffven. A popular tavern called the Tipsy Keg is located there, as well as a forge, and a general goods store.
      </p>
      <h4>The Inner Ring</h4>
      <p>
         This is a smaller ringed structure found higher than the Lower Ring. Some streets span off either side of the main road, but the inwards leading road lead to several tall spires that overlook the city, where upper class citizens congregate. The Barracks are found on the main road, also the library Mindless Discoveries, a potion store, and a temple dedicated to Pelor.
      </p>
      <h4>The Outer Ring</h4>
      <p>
         Many upper class citizens have their abodes at the Outer Ring, a structure that is located to the south side of the central city. It is accessible from the Inner Ring via City Hall, a large collection of buildings to the east of the Inner Ring.
      </p>
      <h4>The Docks</h4>
      <p>
         Travellers from other empires embark and disembark at the main port in Trimor, which is located at the south end of Creswell. Imports and exports are also processed here, making it a perfect location for the Trade Guild. The Creswell Commercial Port (or the Tipsy Sea Serpent) is where people can buy recently shipped in wares. It is a complex set of buildings, connected by many air bridges. Just off to the east of the Commercial Port, are the Tormund Fighting Pits, where tri-weekly tournaments are hosted.
      </p>
      <h4>Cliffven</h4>
      <p>
         The slums of Creswell are the area just south to the entrance to the Inner Ring. A lot of workers in the fields and docks reside here, and a market is set up daily to sell pelts, meats and fish, and homemade trinkets.
      </p>
      <h4>Silverhill Village</h4>
      <p>
         Many farmers and fishermen reside in Silverhill Village, about 3 kilometres to the south off of the main road. Some tend to the farms closer to Creswell, and fishermen set themselves up and down the coast.
      </p>
      <h3>Guilds and Factions</h3>
      <h4>Trade Guild</h4>
      <p>
         The multi-storey building has a wondrous view over the docks, and has Crown-established and independent workers throughout the guild monitoring the imports for distribution across the kingdom, and the exports to be sent away to other empires across Greyspire.
      </p>
      <h4>Grindwall Record</h4>
      <p>
         This division of the Grindwall Record in Creswell specialises in economics and trade.
      </p>
      <h4>Temple to the Dawn Father</h4>
      <p>
         One of the many temples to Pelor is situated here, giving blessings to farmers and forragers, along with anyone else seeking guidance from darkness.
      </p>
      <h3>Geography</h3>
      <p>
         The coastal city sits atop of a small hilly mass. The multiple circular walls show off the city districts which are easily viewable as you approach the city.
      </p>
      <h3>Natural Resources</h3>
      <p>
         Grains, fish, meats.
