         "The Lower Ring": "The Lower Ring is the first ring structure that you reach after ascending the stairs from Cliffven. A popular tavern called the Tipsy Keg is located there, as well as a forge, and a general goods store.",
         "The Inner Ring": "This is a smaller ringed structure found higher than the Lower Ring. Some streets span off either side of the main road, but the inwards leading road lead to several tall spires that overlook the city, where upper class citizens congregate.

      "buldaar": {
         "Description": "The very landlocked town of Buldaar is home to a large concentrated dwarven community. The outskirts of the town, and the road leading up to it, are quite hilly and rocky, which is unusual due to the flat landscape present across the rest of the Crinegard Plains.\nThere is always work available in the mines if you're looking for a job. A rich sense of community is found in the Collarglaive, a suburb where the mines are located. A temple worshiping Moradin is located in the Collarglaive, and is very popular to many.",
         "Demographics": "40% dwarves, 23% halflings, 19% human, 13% gnomes, 3% elves, 2% other races",
         "Government": "There is a small barracks established near the southern entrance, where Starrgard monitor the town. Other than this, there are no set individuals that look over the town.",
         "Defences": "The large rocks that surround the town cause for a tricky, and curvy path up to the main gates. Forts are located along these paths, and are hidden among the stonework, making it tricky to traverse without being spotted. Steel gates can be shut at the town entrance, making it near impossible to conquer from these routes. There is probably no safer place to be in the Crinegard Plains.",
         "Industry": "The Collarglaive are home to many miners of Buldaar, who work to gather coal and ore for their own use, and export throughout the kingdom.",
         "Collarglaive": "In the north-eastern parts of Buldaar is the Collarglaive, a smaller village where a lot dwarves and miners live. Around 2,800 humanoids live here, and most tend to not explore the rest of Buldaar, the dwarves believing in strength among themselves. Everything they need is here, their homes, work, and a bustling tavern.",
         "The Mines": "Buldaar became a successful settlement due to the abundance of strategic resources, including coal and ore. Some also say that there is a source of adamantine in the mines. There are half a dozen mines scattered through the Collarglaive that are predominalty dwarf-worked. The mines are overlooked by a branch of the Trade Guild, ultimately run by the Crown, who keep track of the ores and materials coming out of the mines. There resources are divvied up first to the Crown, and any resources are then sole to blacksmiths and jewellers. Some miners hide rarer gems that they discover, and there are random checks run that encourage those not to steal from the Crown's rightful materials.",
         "The Drunken Ratt": "Located just off of the central town square, this tavern sees some regular business over the working week, but does not get too busy. It has a well lit interior, with the walls and floor being made up of cobblestone. Three evenly-spaced torches appear on the wall opposite the war, with two torches also placed on the wall behind it. Above the door there is an iron shield with dwarven runes inscribed into it, with the familiar red and gold colouring of the Crinegard Plains appearing on the edges of it.",
         "Ye Old Gofer": "This is found in the dwarven village of the Collarglaive. It sees a lot of clientel, particularly at the end of the working week, where predominantly dwarves go to drink away their hard-earned money from working in the mines. Drinks are brought to you upon sitting down at an empty table. It has an open interior. No door and no roof. It has dark, stained wooden floors and low-seating tables. You would not see a bar if you were to look around, and very brief encounters with workers only occur when you are given your drinks.",
         "The Barracks": "The main barracks are found by the south entrance of town, down the rocky ramp that decends from the tall gate. It is a simple one-story building made of stone bricks. The commander of the Starrgard has an office to the left of the reception. Commander Durik was a male dwarf who ran the Starrgard in Buldaar. He was a shorter dwarf with long dark hair. The Starrgard are 50% human, 30% dwarf, and 20% elf outside of the Collarglaive. Inside, they are 80% dwarf, and 20% human.",
         "Greybrew's": "A family run potion store that opened 200 years ago. It has profitted greatly from selling unique and reliable potions to the Crown, and to the odd adventurer who finds their way to Buldaar. Greybrew was the nickname they were given by a rival famliy when the shop first opened, and they took it on as a joke. It is run by Tulbar Greybrew.",
         "Iron Buckle": "A short ginger-haired man by the name of Nozmak is the guy to go to forge anything. He has plenty of items available, and also some finer ones for a higher price.",
         "Gyer's Jewellers": "A gems store and jewellery just north up the road from the central square. Jeffery Gyer runs the joint.",
         "Temple of Moradin": "The Allhammer has been very prominent throughout the Crinegard Plains for centuries, and his central temple is found in the heart of the Collarglaive, at its lowest point, making it easy to spot. Moradin represents loyalty and legacy, and are worshipped by smiths and artisans, as he guides them in the forging of great creations. The silver designs on the items forged match the designs of the clerics and paladins that follow Moradin, and can be seen wandering around the Collarglaive, Buldaar, and even outside the Crinegard Plains.",
         "The Argent Axes": "A guild responsible for the upkeep of the mines and monitoring of the rocky peaks surrounding Buldaar, members of the Argent Axes are trained warriors that are experienced in fighting beasts and anything else that dare to disrupt the secluded way of life on the mountain tops.",
         "Architecture": "The rocky landscape means you hardly find yourself in a flat surface across the town. Very up and down throughout every street. Some buildings are built into a stone wall, while others extend across a dip in the rocks.",
         "Natural Resources": "Coal, ore, some say there are traces of adamantine in the mines."

      "fleydire": {
         "Description": "Fleydire is located on a small island, roughly 25 kilometres squared. It is by The Malva Coast to the west of Creswell. There are raising bridges to the north, and south-east, monitored by Starrgard. Fleydire is a popular tourist spot. The views over The Malva Coast are unmatched with the scenery and delights of food on offer. You can enjoy the coastline while enjoying various seafoods, or spend the night at the casino located in the northern reaches of town. A monastery to Avandra is found in the central square, and all are welcome to gather for worship.",
         "Demographics": "37% humans, 26% dwarves, 18% halflings, 12% elves, 7% other races",
         "Government": "Fleydire is overseen by a small council of eight upper class individuals. These lawmakers monitor various parts of the town, including commerce, trade, and military. The highest ranked individual is a dedicated spokesperson for the town.",
         "Defences": "There are prominent forts located by the two bridges entering the city, who occasionally establish random checkpoints. There are other watch sites along the road beyond the town borders, that keep an eye on traffic. Fleydire provides some support to the village Kengruun, that is located to the east.",
         "Industry": "Tourism produces a fair share of revenue for workers, so tax money allows for the upkeep of defences, equipment of Starrgard, and roads. This also means there are a variety of inns and taverns of all classes. Crops are imported from Kengruun, a village to the east on the road to Creswell. Other foods such as meats, fish, and fruits are hunted and gathered from nearby, which can be found at various stalls in the markets.",
         "Infrastructure": "There is an inn by the southern gate of the town, called the Stoned Cow. This is a bustling inn from Spring to Autumn, with some higher priced rooms having great rooms of the coast. There is a smaller inn located in the central square, named the Coked-Up Gofer.\nThere are markets located on the southern side of the town, that overlook the Malva Coast. A dock can be seen from here that house some larger boats, and a few fishing ships, with a lighthouse to the south-western side. A large bell tower can be seen from most points in the town, that rings five times a day. There are a variety of shops along the main thoroughfare, including some forgers, a general goods store, a bakery, and a butchers.

      "trimor": {
         "The Start of the Third Era": "The Kingdom of Trimor formed nearly three centuries ago, to unite against the fiends that tore through the a rip in the plains. These fiends devastated the Material Plain, destroying barracks, burning fields, and slaying all those who dared cross them. These independent republics that are now united under Trimor, came together for the first time to destroy this evil. The Crimson Malitia were formed under this, then temporary concord, and successfully drove back the fiend army attack over this part of Greyspire over the course of six years. Battle sites are scattered across the plains, and rift openings hidden, and seemingly lost in history. It is not known the underlying reason to their attack, but it ultimately brought a lot of people together. After the battle was finally won, the republics came together and united, ultimately forming under the monarchy of Norlock Starr. The now region of the Starr Grounds had the most resources and largest population, giving it the greatest claim to running the kingdom. The monarchy supports the kingdom as a whole, but each region has a designated capital that oversees the needs for their specific people.",
         "Calendar of Greyspire": "The calendar that is followed across most of the world has 281 days. It is grouped into ten months, and followed through seven day weeks. It has deep elven ancestry, which is visible for the names of the months and days that still represent this calendar these many centuries later. The holidays however, are mainly representative of the days celebrated by all those in Trimor. The days of the week are Dafaren, Raloren, Dormren, Brytren, Yesren, Safareen, and Leoreen.",
         "Starr Grounds": "The home of the capital Billingwood and the monarchy, the Starr Grounds are regarded as the central hub of the kingdom. Highly populous, the Starr Grounds are home to a mixture of races. Originally dominantly human before Trimor was formed, its indigenous culture is relatively no longer present as large groups of other races are scattered across through the townships. The Culderwoods take up a large area of this region, and have been relatively untouched due to how dense it is.",
         "Astesh": "The southern-most region of the western divide, Ashtesh is the gateway east across the peaks of Highgate. A contender for the first settlement of Trimor is Felderwind, where a large amount of lumber and exotic fruits are harvested. The capital Highgate, maintains the flow of people through the divide. A city built into the mountains, dwarvish heritage is rich here.",
         "Oadraar": "The region with a view of the Dire Alps to the north-west, it is the last line before the empire of Farwind. The snowy township of Alldene is a common stop for adventurers before setting foot outside of the kingdom. The western-most settlement of Trimor is the costal city of Zadaar. The region capital is located among a hilly range, and home of the Arcane Conglomerate.",
         "Crinegard Plains": "The beautiful plains of Crinegard are home to the people of the second-most populous region. Originally from dwarven heritage, their culture is interwoven in most settlements throughout the area. Creswell is the region capital and home to the main port and the trade guild. Wanderers travel to Fleydire for a holiday retreat, with many eateries for exotic foods, and a view of the Malva Coast is appetising for most.",
         "Saifra": "Many large costal settlements are found throughout Saifra, with a lot of produce and vegetables being imported from neighbouring regions. However for what this region lacks in farming, it makes up for in mining and engineering. The mines located next to the north-west of its capital Darrington are worked for their coal and ore for production of weapons, armour, and other experimental contraptions.",
         "Endrais": "The hotter climate up the northern end of the eastern reaches makes Endrais one of the lesser inhabited regions of Trimor. The fewer established settlement often accounts for less travel to the region. Monfield has a view over the southern reaches of the Spiked Gate, a haven for shipwrecks if traversed without care. Many ships dock here before a journey through the Cobalt Sound. To the north is the abandoned city of Endes, a settlement that suffered the brunt of the fiend attack. Some say dessert creatures wander the ruins, but others have come back with vast amounts of treasures.",
         "Luria": "The people of Luria, a republic to the south-west, decided to keep their people separate to Trimor after the army of fiends were defeated. They helped keep them at bay during this war, and remain a close ally to this day. Some people travel to Luria for the beautiful sights, while some seek a greater meaning, making a trek to Elder Reach to rediscover themselves.",
         "Farwind": "Across Alldene Pass to the north-west is the plutocracy of Farwind. They are not considered an ally of Trimor, but have a few trade routes stemming through the pass, and along the seas. They had their own dealings with the army of fiends, and kept to themselves during this stressful period.",
         "Pantheons & Deities": "Although there aren't any formally recognised deities in Trimor, there are some more prominent than others. You can find temples to recognised gods and goddesses at most cities and towns, and priests spread the word of their holiness on the streets.",
         "Grindwall Record": "The people who work at The Grindwall Record are the primary keepers of information and specialists in specific research. The formal attire follows the deep purple monarch colour, with different embroidery designs representing the status of its members. There are libraries at every region capital, but the main headquarters are located in Billingwood.",
         "Crimson Malitia": "Formed near the end of the second era, the Crimson Malitia remain the first line of defence across Trimor against other intruders, and are stationed at multiple towns and cities across the kingdom. They can be recognised from the engraved armour, with different colours representing their rank and division.",
         "Starrgard": "Guards patrolling the streets and officers keeping law and order in major and minor settlements are classified as Starrgard, employed directly by the crown, but work on behalf of their regions. Even villages as small as fifty people will have some Starrgard keeping an eye on the peace.",
         "Acrane Conglomerate": "The study and research of magic predominantly takes place at the Arcane Conglomerate. From teaching the arcane practice, to researching new methods of manipulation of matter and energy, this school located in Zadaar is some people's dreams to attend.",
         "Trade Guild": "The Trade Guild is responsible for the moving traffic of goods across the roads and seas of Trimor. The guild is centred in Creswell, as the city is the main port of the kingdom. It is responsible for the imports and exports to and from other empires in Greyspire."

         "Gregor": "Gregor caught up with Lizzie after his parents' death, and got him addicted on lizard venom. Gregor caused his addiction to get so bad, that Lizzie had to make a deal with his witch aunt Arinis, that caused him to turn into a lizard.",
         "Arinis": "Arinis resides in a small hut in the village of Dresden. She was the witch to transform Lizzie into a lizard.",
         "Backstory": "The Osbul family worked day in and day out selling fish in the markets of Muldire only to return to their home in the slums.  Although the work was hard and the pay was little, Bill and Billie Osbul were happy to be with their twin sons Bizzie and Lizzie to have escaped the danger of their past.\n20 years prior, Bill and Billie met at the Arcane Conglomerate where they both had high hopes of becoming powerful wizards. Between classes and late nights making their way through all the books in the grand library, the halfings spent their time with their new friends, Sulqrin the Dragonborn, and Mahana the Half-Elf. Curiosity would often get this gang into trouble, but it was all fun and laughs until one night they discovered a dark secret about the wizard school and the higher powers in charge...\nNothing felt safe anymore, everywhere they went they felt watched, it became clear they all needed to get away fast. On their last night at the school they broke into the tower and stole 4 purple amulets. Even though these amulets would protect them they knew it was best to split up, Sulqrin went south, Mahana went North, while Bill and Billie stuck together, and started to head east. After weeks of travel, Bill and Billie finally stopped in Muldire. Pod, a gnome and retired long-time adventurer could sense the couple's fear and desperation. He brought them into his own home and helped them get to a humble and normal life working in the market. Pod also worked in the market, selling bread.\nWhen the twins were born, Pod again helped out. However once they reached the age of six they started to work with their parents. Bizzie and Lizzie are identical twins but have very different interests and would often fight. Bizzie had a close relationship with Pod, he loved hearing his tales of adventuring and would often go with him to the forest where Pod would teach him how to use a bow and track animals. Meanwhile, Lizzie would much rather play poker with friends.\nIt had been nearly 20 years since Billie and Bill's escape from Zadaar but the parents could sense danger coming, there were strangers in the market and they felt watched again. Bill and Billie knew the time had come and they had been caught, this time there was nowhere to run to. The safety of their children was most important to them and they needed to ensure they were protected once they were gone. To \"mark\" the end of the Winter Solstice, Bill and Billie gifted their amulets to Bizzie and Lizzie. \"As long as you wear this we will be with you\". Bizzie was confused how their parents could afford such a beautiful pendent, Lizzie on the other hand didn't care.\nA week later, while Bizzie and Lizzie were at the docks collecting the fish for their parents there was a freak 'accident' in the market. A feral owlbear had rampaged through the market directly through Bill and Billie's stall, they did not survive. The twins did not know that this wasn't an accident and their parent's past had finally caught up with them.\nIn the next month, Bizzie worked to rebuild his family stall and keep the business going. Every couple of days he would go into the forest with Pod, he perfected his arrow skills, it was his escape and gave him a purpose. Unfortunately, Lizzie couldn't repress his feelings like Bizzie and struggled to be around his brother or the markets.\nLizzie started hanging out at the local tavern (Dragon's blood) where he was reunited with a childhood friend, Gregor. Gregor introduced Lizzie to lizard venom to ease his pain, a powerful and addictive hallucinogen. Bizzie was oblivious to what was going on with his brother.\nGregor's lizard venom dealer was his aunt, a witch from a small village called Dresden. Lizzie couldn't afford anymore lizard venom, but he was completely dependent on it. To keep up his supply he made a deal with Gregor's aunt, he was too out of it to understand what the deal was. The witch was a lonely woman who always wanted a son that could be hunter/gatherer for her. The deal was for Lizzie to give up his young halfling body to the witch, Lizzie's conscience was placed in a giant lizard's body (the source of the venom). During this transformation the amulet broke from its chain.\nGregor and the witch abandoned Lizzie in the lizard form at Bizzie and Lizzie's family home in the slums of Muldire. Gregor and his aunt fled north. With the giant lizard form was a note that read \"Here lies Lizzie Osbul a halfling boy who let addiction become him, his body is ours now\".\nBizzie was left to look after his twin brother, a giant lizard who couldn't even fit in the family home. The giant lizard in the slums of Muldire attracted unwanted attention from neighbors who started throwing rubbish at them which eventually grew into threats. Pod would give Bizzie and Lizzie scraps from his stall, as Bizzie could no longer sell fish at the market due to trying to protect and control his giant lizard brother.\nOne night, Lizzie unaware of his new lizard strength and size accidentally knocked down a wall of a small home in the slums. This was the final straw for the angry slum folk leading them to call for the authorities. As the guardsmen forced Bizzie and Lizzie out of Muldire, Pod saw all the commotion and ran out to Bizzie and quickly handed him a long bow before a guard could stop him. Attached to the long bow was a note that read \"Go to Zadaar and ask for Crela, she can help you and your brother- Pod\".\nBizzie rode Lizzie out of Muldire and started their long journey to Zadaar. This was the first time the brothers had ever left their hometown of Muldire. Bizzie was scared yet intrigued as to what lies beyond Muldire. After one long day of travel the brothers reached the border of the Endrais and Saifra regions. Nestled between the mountains was the small village Vac. Unlike Muldire there were no taverns or markets in Vac, instead the village was made up of small shacks. Village folk mainly halflings and gnomes kept to themselves and were wary of the passing travellers. Bizzie noticed the passing looks and murmurs but as it was getting dark the brothers had no choice but to set up camp in Vac. Little did they know, that the seemingly halfling and gnome community, was run by tyrant goblins, keeping them in check when necessary.\nBizzie woke up alone in a cold and damp cave. The first thing he saw was a group of four goblins crowding around a fire and sifting through Bizzie's belongings. Scrambling to his feet, the goblins heard him and starting making their way towards him. Bizzie goes to reach for his long bow and it isn't there! He attempts to fight by picking up a rock and throwing it. Just as the goblins crowd around him, there's a crashing noise. Lizzie runs in biting two of the goblins throwing each across the cave, smacking over one with his tail and then batting the last one away with his claw. Bizzie now knew this giant lizard was still his brother. Gathering their things set out to leave Vac that very night.\nFor the rest of the journey Bizzie and Lizzie kept to themselves stopping in Darrington and Lassire to sell pelts and meats from Bizzie's hunts.\nBut as they reached Creswell the little coin they had from back home was all gone. It was clear they weren't going to get by on shooting hare and pheasants in a large city like Creswell, it was time to look for some work. When they entered Creswell they noticed large crowds walking down the streets. Intrigued, they followed the crowds into a large stadium..."

Many pray to halt and lessen the wrath of winter, but those who receive her blessing are not spared the bitter cold, rather are only allowed to endure it.\nEmbrace the cold, and all that is brought with it.

Grasp your own fate, and the Change Bringer will be at your back.\nChange is inevitable, but the righteous make change for the better.\nRise against tyranny. Fight for the freedom of yourself and others.",
         "Milil, Guardian of Entertainment": "Even in times of strife, the ballad of a song, or the beauty of a poem can distract the mind for even the smallest time. Milil aims to represent life as a ever-writing ballad, an event in history a verse in a symphony, and a poem shining the light on a kingdom's hard fought victories, and the defeat of its enemies. Many bards and entertainers follow Milil for guidance, and many pay for their ale to share their stories.\nInspire others through what you know. A little happiness is sought for everywhere.\nSpread the truth of the world. A good story is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.\nEncourage other to explore the arts. Keep history intact for the future generations to come.",

The All-Seeing's main temple is situated in Zadaar, and those who worship him aim to make the trek there once in their lifetime's to see him in all his glory.\nShare your knowledge with those who seek it. Teaching others in what you have learned can further understanding, rather than letting it die out.\nActively seek out further knowledge. Nothing is ever fully understood.\nShow off you work and hold your discoveries at the highest esteem.",
         "Torm, the Ally on the Battlefield": "One of the oldest represented deities in Trimor, Torm is worshiped by members of the Crimson Malitia, and paladins of duty and loyality. The brand of Torm shines bright at any branch or encampment across the kingdom, and the word of his might is shared across the kingdom.\nBe the champion of the weak and defenceless. Protect those who do not possess the power you wield. Care for the sick and aid the distressed.\nBe stern and just in your battles with evil. Make war upon evil without cessation. Let your wrath destroy the wicked.\nServe the common good and the rule of law. Your duties are towards protecting others. Strive to do so by questioning unjust laws, and suggesting improvements."
