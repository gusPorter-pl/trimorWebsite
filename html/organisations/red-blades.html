            The Red Blades are a domestic terrosim group founded in 3E-284, by General Commander 
            <span class="link"><a href="../npcs/thria-bartek.html">Thria Bartek</a></span>. They have taken over an abandoned fort at the top of the mouths of rivers leading into the lake just north of 
            <span class="link"><a href="../settlements/fleydire.html">Fleydire</a></span>.
         </p>
         <p>
            They have already seeded themselves into the Crinegard Plains across the year 3e-286. Using a mysterious black goo, they can turn creatures into zombie-like depictions of their former selves. They plan to disrupt the Crimson Festival in Fleydire, on the opening night/day.

         <h2>Layout</h2>
         <p>
            The eastern side of the emcampment shows two make-shift wooden forts, with an entrance between them. On either side are wooden logs shaved to make spikes, grouped together to make a fence line. This looks to go all the way around.
         </p>
         <p>
            An old abandoned fort makes up the south-western end of the encampment. It has three stories, and a roof where you can see a few individuals watching over. It peaks over the entire emcampment.
         </p>
         <p>
            A courtyard is at the northern end of the camp. It has a few tables set up, and some cooking pots. There is also a couple of tents with supplies.

         <h2>Conversations</h2>
         <p>
            You catch them mid conversation. Bartek has her arms folded, leaning over a table, with a human individual in a dark deep green robe, standing elegantly, with their arms at their side.
         </p>
         <p>
            Bartek: I don't care how they found out about it, I just want to know if they have discovered our other plans.
         </p>
         <p>
            The human male starts to walk to the other side of the table.
         </p>
         <p>
            Grunhofe: I can assure you Thria, the discovery of the Fleydarian assault was by shear luck, they cannot know of our next moves, only we two know this.
         </p>
         <p>
            Bartek: Then can you see why I am fucking anxious Grunhofe? Only we knew of these attacks before they occurred. How can I know that it wasn't you, or one of your compatriates, who leaked this information?
         </p>
         <p>
            The human male takes his hands from his side and places them on the table, confronting Bartek.
         </p>
         <p>
            Grunhofe: Because Thria, we have a deal. You know that if you cannot accomplish what you want to do, I won't be able to get my end of the bargain, and then you are going to have a lot more to worry about than your pesky 'cleanse' being ruined.
