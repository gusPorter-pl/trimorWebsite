            The Red Blades are a domestic terrosim group founded in 3E-284, by 
            <span class="link"><a href="../npcs/thria-bartek.html">General Commander Thria Bartek</a></span>. They have taken over an abandoned fort at the top of the mouths of rivers leading into the lake just north of 
            <span class="link"><a href="../settlements/fleydire.html">Fleydire</a></span>.
         </p>
         <p>
            They have already seeded themselves into the Crinegard Plains across the year 3e-286. Using a mysterious black goo, they can turn creatures into zombie-like depictions of their former selves. They plan to disrupt the Crimson Festival in Fleydire, on the opening night/day.
