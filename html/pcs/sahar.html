         <h2>Backstory</h2>
         <p>
            Sahar is the youngest member of the Gohvnarrun blacksmithing family. Brought up in the depths of the Kahf'nduwel mines, deep in the mountains to the east of Blackpool Bay. Taught the craft of blacksmithing by his parents Shakush and Chruman as soon as he was able to hold a hammer, Sahar spent his early years in the shadow of his elder brother Haddad and twin sister Hama, who each took with far more ease to both shield and forge. Sahar's friendly and curious nature set him apart from his community who were deeply mistrustful of the world outside their mountain, and instead valued wisdom and strength that were strictly tied to stone and sword. When he reached young adulthood the leaders of his clan encouraged him to explore the surrounding mountains with the fighters and clerics, mistrustful of the influence he might wield underground with his comparatively silver tongue and bookish mind. Taking this as his chance to leave the Deep while still on good terms with his family and clan, Sahar left at nineteen years old to spend several years roaming the mountain range above Kahf'nduwel and the wild woods beyond, banding with fighters and adventurers who made their way through the ranges.

            By his mid twenties, Sahar had earned enough as a journeyman smith to set up his own practice, at the port community of Crosskeep by the water where the ranges met the woods at Blackpool Bay. It was here that Sahar first came across dedicated spellcasters outside of the clerics of Kahf'nduwel. The arcane magics had long been regarded with suspicion by the shield dwarves of the mountains, however Sahar was soon exposed to sailors of diverse backgrounds, and found he had an affinity for others who were oft treated with suspicion, and with those who were uncomfortable with, or even outcast from, their home communities. In his time as the smithy of Crosskeep, Sahar made fast friends with Eldorwyn, a bard of both elven and human descent, and her companion Filkna, a tiefling warlock. Eldorwyn and Filkna had studied together at the Arcane Conglomerate before sailing the seas for many years as adventurers and mages-for-hire. Now comfortably middle aged, the two women run the local pub that hosts visitors to the small town. Over a long night of ale and song, the pair cajoled Sahar into trying his hand at rune casting, and discovered a quick aptitude for divination. With Filkna and Eldorwyn's encouragement, he began studying the arcane, bartering for spell books and occult tomes with those who passed through the area. During this time of autodidacticism, Sahar had a casual romance with Lucan Velvere, a half drow druid who would spend his winters at port. Over six winters, Sahar and Lucan would together practice rune casting, share in fine ale, and enjoy one another's company. To celebrate his thirty sixth summer with his twin sister, Sahar took a brief sojourn back to Kahf'nduwel, the home of his heart where he would always be regarded as an oddity. With the grudging blessing and respect of his family and leaders, Sahar left his smithy at Crosskeep to enrol at the Arcane Conglomerate.

	         Initially uncomfortable in lands away from the familiar shelter of his mountains, Sahar dove into study with single minded focus. Over time, his odd charisma and outlandish background endeared him to few of his peers; while many found him a source of amusement or spectacle, the eccentric dwarf was well respected for his stoic logical thinking, sharp insights into arcane history, and gruff friendly manner. In his early years of study, Sahar befriended his fellow scholars Pip Stonesong, a gnomish tinkerer with an aptitude for illusions, and Agafa Setare, a human sorcerer and finesmith. Over time, Sahar's relationship with Agafa developed into a close romantic companionship, and together they opened a smithy and jewellery store in Zadaar, where Sahar was able to make a modest living and support the community while continuing his research of arcane history and study of divination. Despite his unusual aptitude for spellcasting and decision to commit his life's work to the study of the arcane, Sahar maintained his bond with Kahf'nduwel, and made the journey each year to spend his age day with his family under the mountain. This annual visit came to a brief end when, after two decades of partnership, Agafa fell deathly ill, and Sahar closed up shop to support his beloved through her final years. Upon her deathbed, Agafa asked Sahar to seek out her long estranged brother, Gafan, and to pass along her life's research into the fey blood curse that had led to her, and her family's, demise. Unable to process or confront his own grief, Sahar acted with single-minded focus, selling what was left of his belongings, collecting the final, most pertinent findings, of Agafa's research, and his own research into the obscured history of dwarvish spellcasting, into bound books, and promptly leaving Zadaar with little fanfare. For the first time in three years, Sahar returned to Crosskeep where he broke bread with Filkna and Eldorwyn, whom he gifted Agafa's last creations: pendants set with chips of the very same purple gem mined from the heart of Kahf'nduwel that he had fashioned into an arcane focus for his quarterstaff. He then made his way home to spend time with his family and share with his elders the bounty of his research, giving himself three months to aid the community through the sharing of knowledge and forgery of weaponry for the shield dwarves, before seeking adventure and, with it, news of where he might find Gafan.
