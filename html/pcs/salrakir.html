         <h2>Backstory</h2>
         <div class="h3">An Heir of Dread Maw</div>
         <p>
            Griangath, son of Griangoth the leader of Dread Maw. Never met my mother and know little of her. My father was not affectionate towards me and treated me like any other member of Dread Maw even though I was a potential heir along with my brother Griangyth, who was heavily favoured. I wanted to make him recognise me so I rose through the ranks until I was one of the top members; possible due to my magical prowess and natural leadership abilities. He finally started to acknowledge my skills even if his treatment of me didn’t change. I became battle hardened and eventually was made leader of the 2nd division, leading many of my friends in Dread Maw, along with Eldarenth, my closest friend.
         </p>
         <p>
            At a battle near the Culderwoods I found a peasant woman who caught my eye, she had a strange air about her that I knew set her apart. I discovered we shared the same birth mark on the outer thigh. We realized that she was my mother and I saved her, secretly housing her away from the prying eyes of my family and other Dread Maw members. We grow close as she is very caring and the exact opposite of my father. She told me that my father had raped her and then when I was born he discarded her and she's only barely managed to survive until now doing physically exhausting labour in a poor town. I believed this story as it was similar to Griangyth’s and how his mother was treated by Griangoth. Eventually I agreed to help her with a plot to temporarily poison my father so that we have enough time to run away together where he can't find us and start a new life. As leaving Dread Maw is heavily frowned upon, for an heir to do it is unheard of.
         </p>
         <p>
            When my father is weak from poison she appears with my brother at her side. She finally shows her true form, a powerful tiefling sorcerer of the Umbra Circle, Marfaris. Revealing the truth of her plot, she kills my father in front of me. In his dying words he expresses his remorse in not being able to treat me according to his true feelings, and laments that if he had been strong enough to do so, perhaps I wouldn’t have felt the need to escape from him, inadvertently assisting Marfaris in her plot.
         </p>
         <p>
            As he lays dying the Carryns enter, alerted by the powerful magical blast that felled Griangoth. They are easily apprehended by her magic and forced to watch their friends die. Acknowledging that my lack of affinity to dark magic suggests that her ritual failed and that I am in no way special, she still offers me the chance to join her as I am of her blood and still possess magical ability that she can put to use. When I refuse she seemingly kills me with her dark magic. With my father (and presumably me) dead, Dread Maw was at a decisive moment. As Marfaris and Griangyth worked quickly to blame the Carryn's for poisoning my father and murdering me, only a few loyal to me and my father who trusted the Carryn's believed their side of the story. The Carryn's narrowly managed to escape after telling some of their allies within Dread Maw the truth, allowing a few to flee with them. I may have some allies still in Dread Maw that were loyal to my father, but I'm not certain. Assuming me dead, Dread Maw moved on, leaving me behind in a comatose state.
         </p>
         <div class="h3">Visions of a Greater Power</div>
         <p>
            Marfaris' magic which was intended to kill me accidentally this left me in a state in the brink of life and death. In this state I saw visions of another plane. All of my senses were smothered and I was unable to move. I felt myself being reborn into darkness, hearing words I understood but couldn't comprehend resounding in my mind. Eventually I would start to see dark colours swirling in front of me. With time they began to look like tentacles groping the air. They seemed to cradle me and protect me from harm, though it seemed more instinctual than due to purposeful thoughts. As my eyes adjusted I eventually I was able to see further into this world to the source of these tentacles. I saw a strange tentacled creature with many goat parts protruding from what can only be described as, for lack of a better word, its body. As I became slightly more aware and gained some kind of control over my form I started to look around. I could see many other tentacles holding other creatures in a similar suspended state. Although these beings more resembled the source of the tentacles than any living thing I could imagine.  It felt like I existed on that plane for a portion of my life that time became irrelevant. Upon awakening it took me a days to remember myself, slowing my recovery further. Despite feeling that this vision lasted longer than my life previous to it, the memories more or less faded as my material life came back to me.
         </p>
         <div class="h3">New Allies</div>
         <p>
            Eventually I was discovered by Gaddabrin Granitemaul and her dire wolf Mako. She's poor and was scavenging the burnt ruins of Dread Maw's old encampment when Mako found me. Seeing me in a wretched state, and feeling guilty for scavenging through other's misfortune, she took me in. Mako also took a liking to me, and Gaddabrin  trusts his instincts.
         </p>
         <p>
            During my time with the Granitemauls, my appearance began to change more towards being a Tiefling. Upon finding me I was slightly discoloured but we all assumed it was due to the fire and extended malnourishment. But as I healed more I turned a deeper purple and started sprouting very tiny horns. This was an upsetting discovery for me as it was a constant reminder that I was linked to Marfaris.
         </p>
         <p>
            One day I went to the village to buy some supplies when a Gnomish poacher by the name of Orkas, and his entourage, gave me a bit of trouble for being a Tiefling saying how they would kill me and sell my horns for a good price if they were bigger. I managed to convince them to let me go because there were some soldiers nearby. But I didn't realize they followed me home. That night they attacked us. We were outnumbered and I had not yet learned how to use my new shadow magic very effectively, feeling that I had lost a lot of the magic power I used to have. To my surprise the Granitemauls were very good in a fight and were assisted by many Dire Wolves. Even so, there were a lot more enemies than us, and I was not fully recovered or pulling my weight. Although I did manage to defeat a couple of them, I was exhausted and about to be killed when Mako sacrificed himself to save me. In the end we barely managed to kill enough of them that the rest ran away.
         </p>
         <p>
            Fearing another attack from Orkas, the Granitemauls abandoned their farm and started looking for somewhere new to live. They were thinking of staying with Gaddabrin's sister Kabada for a time. Not wanting to create anymore trouble for the Granitemauls, and needing to start finding clues about Dread Maw and the Carryn's, we decided we would soon part ways. Gaddabrin knows a riverboat operator from her past. He allowed us to cross from Wellwood towards Darrington. We then split as they headed toward her sister Kadaba in Monfield, and I went to follow a lead to find the Carryn family in the Crinegard plains.
         </p>
         <div class="h3">A Journey through Unknown Lands</div>
         <p>
            Salrakir had to pass by Darrington in order to get to Creswell. He stopped in to get some supplies although was cautious of the wider population after the run in with Orkas. While there he met a former member of Dread Maw, Bemir Hinal, someone that had been under his command. Seeing him reminded Salrakir of his past as commander of the 2nd division, and gave him back some confidence he had lost after his near death experience and identity crisis.
         </p>
         <p>
            His friend told him that Dread Maw had lost some of its numbers as some people loyal to Griangoth/Fhaornik/Griangath were able to escape after the coup. Nevertheless, Dread Maw were regrouping and expanding at a rapid pace, I assume due to Marfaris' influences. He told me that most of my division left either as soon as the coup happened or some a few weeks later when they saw the way it was being run. He had left later and so saw that Griangyth was a ruthless leader and likely to make waves once they have gathered more forces. Discovering that I was alive he urged me to avenge my father and take control of Dread Maw, saying loyalists who were unable to escape still exist and would support my claim.
         </p>
         <p>
            With his help I gathered some information on where other potential deserters may be who would help me take down Griangyth. Bemir could not join my cause as he was now looking after his elderly parents, but his brother Naran, also from my division, should be somewhere near Fleydire as a sell sword and might assist me in getting revenge or at least finding Griangyth.
         </p>
         <p>
            Passed through Lassire where someone recognized my belt sigil. They didn't know its significance but said they had seen some hooded folk with a similar symbol pass through a few months ago, seemingly heading towards Creswell.
         </p>
         <p>
            In Creswell the mood seemed a bit more relaxed and the fact that I was a tiefling didn't seem to bother people as much. I realized that I couldn't hide my appearance and instead would embrace the fact that I stand out. If I'm known as Salrakir then I will be forgotten as Griangath son of Griangoth. Feeling the most free I had since becoming a tiefling I impulsively went to a large gathering at the local fighting pit as a distraction.
