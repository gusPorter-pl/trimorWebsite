         <p>
            ShrinE'rune Yinwenys was the rightful heir to the throne of the Numenlaiquan Kingdom. She gave up her right, and transtively destroyed the kingdom, when she announced she would marry Exius.
         </p>
         <h2>Backstory</h2>
         <p>
            Xaylor Xautner was once ShrinE'rune Yinwenys. I am a drow elf Paladin. I was once a princess, the direct heir to the Numenlaiqua throne. I was born in 2e-471.
         </p>
         <p>
            Numenlaiqua was a kingdom beyond the Dire Alps, well into Farwind. The crystal kingdom of Numenlaiqua was an extremely powerful and rich city made entirely of purple crystal. At the top of the highest tower of the queen's palace there is a bolt full of high level spells.
         </p>
         <p>
            Our society was matriarchal, and it was ruled that queens of the kingdom must remain unmarried, only conceiving children from the large male harem.
         </p>
         <p>
            But because this was a very mysterious kingdom, this fact was largely unknown. We became a very secretive society to protect ourselves during the fiend invasion of 2e-471. We only began opening up our society again around 3e-60.
         </p>
         <p>
            I was the youngest daughter out of 6 brothers. They were all very protective of me because I would be queen, but also because I was naiive, bright eyed, passionate, with a taste for adventure.
            Everything changed when the evil wizard family, the Hartdüm arrived. They wanted the powerful crystal amulet that allows its holder to rule the kingdom and produce infinite amounts of growing, magical crystal, which can be grown into great buildings with turrets, tunnels, and bath houses.
         </p>
         <p>
            The Hartdüms thought the way to do this was to win over my heart. So Norzax Hartdüm, king regent Wizard of Farwind, hatched a plan with his wife Prileyra that their son Exius would fall at the gate of Numenlaiqua, pretending to be a sick traveler. Once taken in by the Numenlaiquans he managed to "stumble upon" me, limping and pathetic, in the crystal gardens and produced a beautiful magic flame for me. I was smitten!
         </p>
         <p>
            So he manipulated me to fall in love with him! And I fell madly in love, he even managed to charm my brothers. He told us that he was from a prestigious Wizard family that he had "lost" on his travels. My brothers set out to find them and organized a seemingly beautiful and tearful reunion. He insisted we marry. My family warned me that if I married a mortal I would have to give up my claim to the throne and my immortality.
         </p>
         <p>
            But they had a contingency plan for this, they wanted me to be happy, so a distant female cousin could take my place. They accepted that I loved him as love is highly valued in our society.
         </p>
         <p>
            In a ceremony never seen before in my Numenlaiqua, I publicly announced to the kingdom that I loved this wizard and that I would be giving up my claim to the throne for him. In that moment the Hartdüm's plan was unknowingly ruined. I heard a shriek from his sister Syphax, who had accompanied Exius to the ceremony with her husband Yorg. As I turned at the sound of her hysterical shrieking, I saw that Exius was no longer by my side.
         </p>
         <p>
            As I searched for him through the palace I found his sister over my mother's, Riniya Yinwenys, broken and dead body, holding the Crystal amulet of Numenlaiqua in her hand. I realized that my mother must have kept the amulet on her person, keeping it safe from the Hartdüms. Syphax shrieked at me that I was stupid and naiive to think her brother would ever love me that he only wanted me for my throne. She said that we were weak for allowing women to rule.
         </p>
         <p>
            I was incensed and beyond heartbroken, we grappled briefly but my anger was so much that I knocked the sister unconscious and in my blind rage, took her and the crystal and left on my spirit steed for the nearest mountain range 2 hours from the castle, leaving my kingdom unattended. I did not realise that I was being followed by her husband Yorg Brunstørm.
         </p>
         <p>
            Little did I know that my fiancee was also searching for the crystal throughout the palace, destined to steal it. He went to the bolt at the top of the highest tower, which was full of spells, because he thought that is where it lay.
         </p>
         <p>
            I arrived at a cave in the near Mount Rædner, and in undercommon, began to summon the dragon that lay within. The unconscious Syphax lay at it's entrance.
         </p>
         <p>
            Just beyond the treeline, Her husband Yorg saw me speaking enchantments, and as a wizard who was shamefully born with weaker powers, feared I was going to kill his wife and that he could not defeat me, he began to run back to get help from his brother.
         </p>
         <p>
            My eldest brother met the Exius at the bolt, and told him that the crystal was now always carried by my mother, since she secretly didn't trust the wizarding family since they moved into town!
         </p>
         <p>
            Exius killed my brother with a thunderbolt and searched for a book of spells. He thought he found a spell that would materialise the crystal into his hands, but because he had not yet mastered the Numenlaiquan dialect of elvish, he accidentally cast a spell that brought a meteorite onto the kingdom.
         </p>
         <p>
            Meanwhile, the wizard's sister awoke to see a giant dragon standing above her. I told her, through tears in my eyes, that because of her family's greed, that now no one can possess the crystal and I threw the crystal into the dragon's mouth.
         </p>
         <p>
            She screamed in rage as I instructed for the dragon to burn her to smithereens. As I knelt, weeping, over her burnt corpse I felt an explosion so great that both me and the dragon were thrown across the mountain.
         </p>
         <p>
            When I came to, I saw a huge fire, with flames thousands of feet high erupting from where my kingdom used to be. In grief and shock I sprinted to see if there were any survivors.
         </p>
         <p>
            Yorg, injured from the explosion that rocked the landscape around the kingdom, stumbled through the mountain range to see something I had missed in my bereavement and heartbreak; a dragon, writhing in pain, as his body became crystal and his heart shone gold, it's beating visible through its now clear, crystal skin. It's heart had become the Crystal of Numenlaiqua!!
         </p>
         <p>
            After seeing the crater that used to be my kingdom, my whole family and race dead, my passion for adventure became a lust for revenge.
         </p>
         <p>
            For the 231 years I sought to kill every member of the Wizard's family, and the Wizard's family have hunted for me ever since.
         </p>
         <p>
            I traveled South to Astrakhan, the castle of the Hartdüm wizards where I broke in and stabbed Norzax and Prileyra. After I killed Norzax and Prileyra, Yorg and Exius' other sisters Urune and Epharis, chased me through Alldene pass.
         </p>
         <p>
            From there I ran to the Culderwoods where I hid for 50 years. I changed my name to Ryre. The people of the surrounding villages often told stories of a pale purple waif of an elf girl that you can hear crying if you walked through the woods. I became a shell of my former self, dirty, emaciated, barely humanoid. I met a cruel and embittered Tiefling named Mavakas. We slept in the same giant oak tree, barely spoke, but I caught animals for him and slowly he began to teach me the paladin arts - of fighting, of sensing types of magic, of calling for spirit steeds.
         </p>
         <p>
            One day the grandsons of Yorg came for me in the woods, they mortally wounded Mavakas. I hid beneath the roots of a giant tree, listening to Mavakas' screams. When I found, him I told him that I wished to die with him as I had nothing left for me in this life. He told me that he sensed that Yorg's grandsons knew something I didn't, he could tell in their desperation to kill me. He told me I needed to keep fighting, and that I was ready to become a paladin. He told me to go to the sea on the shore of Mournstead and pledge an oath to the Moonmaiden, Selune. She would often answer the prayers of forlorn women. As he died in my arms my anger became tenfold. I would take an Oath of Vengence with Selune.
         </p>
         <p>
            I limped for 4 days to Mournstead. The year was 3e-111. When I got there I ate scraps and slept in the gutter for a day before I dragged myself to the coast. I walked into the shore, I wanted the sea to take me, I called out that if Selune did not take me then I would resign myself to drowning. As I began to drown I heard a beautiful song, it guided me to the shore. I washed ashore and saw a beautiful silver-haired maiden with lime green eyes before me. She told me that she could see that I sought vengeance in my heart, and that I deserved that vengeance, for my family, for Mavakas. She said there were also other things in life to seek, if I promised her that I would seek those, that I would be allowed to pledge an Oath of Vengeance with her. I submitted to do so.
         </p>
         <p>
            It was at that moment that I got my divine powers. I felt so strong and I also became beautiful. I became statuesque, elegant, fiery and strong. I was ready to wipe out the Hartdüm wizards, not only for myself but now also for Selune. I set out to Alldene to hone my fighting skills, supplementing this lifestyle by maintaining a life as a reclusive and beautiful Blacksmith. I did this for 10 years.
         </p>
         <p>
            I got wind that one of Yorg's grandsons was in Prestonville. I caught him alone in the library and killed him. I escaped from the two other grandsons back into the Culderwoods. From there I hid for 15 years in Emall. In 3e-136 I commandeered a boat and crept back into Prestonville where I killed the other two grandsons by holding a knife to one grandsons throat and using compelled deul on the other, forcing him to stab his brother as I used him as a human shield. I was then able to kill the other with ease. It was there that I learnt that Urune Hartdüm married a wizard with the last name Flamehide and that the Hartdüms, of which there were Norzax's two remaining brothers Cassius and Polybotro, had changed their last names to Patrax. I was yet to find anything on Epharis.
         </p>
         <p>
            I found that the Flamehides had founded an Arcane Conglomerate in Zadaar. So, I went back to Alldene to my old blacksmith to fashion a longsword, then spent five years in Runswik going back and forth from there to Zadaar to learn the layout of the Conglomerate and to master searing smite.
         </p>
         <p>
            One full moon during the winter month of Holaris in 3e-141, after praying for two weeks to Selune and feeling her divinity, I snuck into the Arcane Conglomerate and set it on fire. This successfully killed the entire Flamehide clan, but I lost the knowledge of Epharis' family and their new name. Their good wizard students would later rebuild the conglomerate under a new set of values; centered on the equal distribution of knowledge for all, as opposed to the elitist principles of the Flamehides.
         </p>
         <p>
            For seventy years, I played cat and mouse with a number of different wizards, either having to run and hide for a time or managing to kill them in battle. They never sent more than one family member to assassinate me to protect their line, and whenever I capture one, they always kill themselves before I can find out what became of Epharis' family or of their secret.
         </p>
         <p>
            In 3e-212 I mothered a child with an unruly adventurer in my old haunt of Alldene. During my pregnancy I found the nearest town with a large elf population, Felderwind. Found an elven cleric that knew of the Numenlaiquans who sheltered me from Hartdüms throughout my pregnancy. I then went back to Alldene and left my son with his father. His father was called Bjorn Thors, I named the child Gholqaen, after my eldest brother.
         </p>
         <p>
            While crossing the Cobalt Sounds during the summer on 3e-245, I overheard an elf grumbling in elven about some wizards who were strangely abusive towards elves, particularly drow elves. I pulled him aside and bribed him for more information. He said that he was trading with them and caught them signing papers with fake identities. He filed for a Starrgard investigation into the family and found out that they were from the Nïm family. I have spent the last 40 years following this lead into the Nïm family.
         </p>
         <p>
            Anyone with these last names are descendants of the wizard family Hartdüm and have pledged an oath at birth to kill me and find the dragon.
         </p>
         <p>
            There are two other families who have descended from the Hartdüms. These are descended from Norzak Hartdüm's two brothers, Yunil and Thraxorn, who changed their last name to Patrax. They only have a prejudice toward elves and believe their distant cousins, the Nïm, are delusional for believing in the Great Crystal Dragon.
         </p>
         <p>
            Like my former fiance, the Nïm wizards are master manipulators and can disguise themselves as anyone. It is their family's destiny to not only kill me but to take the heart of the crystal dragon (who is now missing) and regrow the crystal kingdom, but under their own rule.
         </p>
         <p>
            I have changed my name many times. I was once Ryre, then I was Trajine, Ilsevel and now Xaylor. My son is also searching for me, he knew me as Ilsevel.
         </p>
         <p>
            I do not know the dragon exists, I only seek to kill the wizard family.
         </p>
         <p>
            I also am looking for meaning in life. I am looking to love again but I won't admit that to anyone, not even to myself. I am also in denial that I could find this meaning in my son. The descendants of the Hartdüm wizards yearn to find me but also to hide from me. Lest I find and kill them but also find out the secret of the crystal dragon!!!
