         <h2>Backstory</h2>
         <p>
            The Osbul family worked day in and day out selling fish in the markets of Muldire only to return to their home in the slums.  Although the work was hard and the pay was little, Bill and Billie Osbul were happy to be with their twin sons Bizzie and Lizzie to have escaped the danger of their past. 
         </p>
         <p>
            20 years prior, Bill and Billie met at the Arcane Conglomerate where they both had high hopes of becoming powerful wizards. Between classes and late nights making their way through all the books in the grand library, the halfings spent their time with their new friends, Sulqrin the Dragonborn, and Mahana the Half-Elf. Curiosity would often get this gang into trouble, but it was all fun and laughs until one night they discovered a dark secret about the wizard school and the higher powers in charge...
         </p>
         <p>
            Nothing felt safe anymore, everywhere they went they felt watched, it became clear they all needed to get away fast. On their last night at the school they broke into the tower and stole 4 purple amulets. Even though these amulets would protect them they knew it was best to split up, Sulqrin went south, Mahana went North, while Bill and Billie stuck together, and started to head east. After weeks of travel, Bill and Billie finally stopped in Muldire. Pod, a gnome and retired long-time adventurer could sense the couple's fear and desperation. He brought them into his own home and helped them get to a humble and normal life working in the market. Pod also worked in the market, selling bread.
         </p>
         <p>
            When the twins were born, Pod again helped out. However once they reached the age of six they started to work with their parents. Bizzie and Lizzie are identical twins but have very different interests and would often fight. Bizzie had a close relationship with Pod, he loved hearing his tales of adventuring and would often go with him to the forest where Pod would teach him how to use a bow and track animals. Meanwhile, Lizzie would much rather play poker with friends.
         </p>
         <p>
            It had been nearly 20 years since Billie and Bill's escape from Zadaar but the parents could sense danger coming, there were strangers in the market and they felt watched again. Bill and Billie knew the time had come and they had been caught, this time there was nowhere to run to. The safety of their children was most important to them and they needed to ensure they were protected once they were gone. To "mark" the end of the Winter Solstice, Bill and Billie gifted their amulets to Bizzie and Lizzie. "As long as you wear this we will be with you". Bizzie was confused how their parents could afford such a beautiful pendent, Lizzie on the other hand didn't care.
         </p>
         <p>
            A week later, while Bizzie and Lizzie were at the docks collecting the fish for their parents there was a freak 'accident' in the market. A feral owlbear had rampaged through the market directly through Bill and Billie's stall, they did not survive. The twins did not know that this wasn't an accident and their parent's past had finally caught up with them. 
         </p>
         <p>
            In the next month, Bizzie worked to rebuild his family stall and keep the business going. Every couple of days he would go into the forest with Pod, he perfected his arrow skills, it was his escape and gave him a purpose. Unfortunately, Lizzie couldn't repress his feelings like Bizzie and struggled to be around his brother or the markets. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Lizzie started hanging out at the local tavern (Dragon's blood) where he was reunited with a childhood friend, Gregor. Gregor introduced Lizzie to lizard venom to ease his pain, a powerful and addictive hallucinogen. Bizzie was oblivious to what was going on with his brother. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Gregor's lizard venom dealer was his aunt, a witch from a small village called Dresden. Lizzie couldn't afford anymore lizard venom, but he was completely dependent on it. To keep up his supply he made a deal with Gregor's aunt, he was too out of it to understand what the deal was. The witch was a lonely woman who always wanted a son that could be hunter/gatherer for her. The deal was for Lizzie to give up his young halfling body to the witch, Lizzie's conscience was placed in a giant lizard's body (the source of the venom). During this transformation the amulet broke from its chain. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Gregor and the witch abandoned Lizzie in the lizard form at Bizzie and Lizzie's family home in the slums of Muldire. Gregor and his aunt fled north. With the giant lizard form was a note that read "Here lies Lizzie Osbul a halfling boy who let addiction become him, his body is ours now". 
         </p>
         <p>
            Bizzie was left to look after his twin brother, a giant lizard who couldn't even fit in the family home. The giant lizard in the slums of Muldire attracted unwanted attention from neighbors who started throwing rubbish at them which eventually grew into threats. Pod would give Bizzie and Lizzie scraps from his stall, as Bizzie could no longer sell fish at the market due to trying to protect and control his giant lizard brother. 
         </p>
         <p>
            One night, Lizzie unaware of his new lizard strength and size accidentally knocked down a wall of a small home in the slums. This was the final straw for the angry slum folk leading them to call for the authorities. As the guardsmen forced Bizzie and Lizzie out of Muldire, Pod saw all the commotion and ran out to Bizzie and quickly handed him a long bow before a guard could stop him. Attached to the long bow was a note that read "Go to Zadaar and ask for Crela, she can help you and your brother- Pod".
         </p>
         <p>
            Bizzie rode Lizzie out of Muldire and started their long journey to Zadaar. This was the first time the brothers had ever left their hometown of Muldire. Bizzie was scared yet intrigued as to what lies beyond Muldire. After one long day of travel the brothers reached the border of the Endrais and Saifra regions. Nestled between the mountains was the small village Vac. Unlike Muldire there were no taverns or markets in Vac, instead the village was made up of small shacks. Village folk mainly halflings and gnomes kept to themselves and were wary of the passing travellers. Bizzie noticed the passing looks and murmurs but as it was getting dark the brothers had no choice but to set up camp in Vac. Little did they know, that the seemingly halfling and gnome community, was run by tyrant goblins, keeping them in check when necessary.
         </p>
         <p>
            Bizzie woke up alone in a cold and damp cave. The first thing he saw was a group of four goblins crowding around a fire and sifting through Bizzie's belongings. Scrambling to his feet, the goblins heard him and starting making their way towards him. Bizzie goes to reach for his long bow and it isn't there! He attempts to fight by picking up a rock and throwing it. Just as the goblins crowd around him, there's a crashing noise. Lizzie runs in biting two of the goblins throwing each across the cave, smacking over one with his tail and then batting the last one away with his claw. Bizzie now knew this giant lizard was still his brother. Gathering their things set out to leave Vac that very night. 
         </p>
         <p>
            For the rest of the journey Bizzie and Lizzie kept to themselves stopping in Darrington and Lassire to sell pelts and meats from Bizzie's hunts. 
         </p>
         <p>   
            But as they reached Creswell the little coin they had from back home was all gone. It was clear they weren't going to get by on shooting hare and pheasants in a large city like Creswell, it was time to look for some work. When they entered Creswell they noticed large crowds walking down the streets. Intrigued, they followed the crowds into a large stadium...
