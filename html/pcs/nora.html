         <p>
            Gnome, age 420, "The thug life can't handle me"
         </p>
         <div class="h3">Orphanage</div>
         <p>
            Nora was left at Salts End foundry in Zadaar after her parents' untimely death. She grew up surrounded by dozens of other kids, most of which were much bigger than her and so she learnt how to survive in a tough situation; mainly by making the right friends and staying in the shadows. Zirruc, a dwarf, Cressa a half-elf, and Griph a half-orc, became her best friends and they would often spend their time fighting monsters (who often took the form of older kids) and pulling elaborate heists on the kitchen. Needless to say their antics caused more than a little mayhem around the house and the group found themselves out on the streets as soon as they hit their mid teens. They promised each other that they would stay together, but life has a way of crushing ship dish dreams, especially in the streets of Zadaar.
         </p>
         <div class="h3">A Thief's Apprentice</div>
         <p>
            After a couple years of begging and thieving the crew eventually went their separate ways. Zirruc went to find his fortune, Cressa found herself at the end of the executioner's rope after one too many violent muggings and Griph joined the city guard. Nora found herself picking pockets and barely dodging the law all by herself until one day, she had the misfortune of getting caught with her hand in the pockets of Mr Silver. Mr Silver was, unbeknownst to Nora at the time, the co-founder and acting head of the Solemn Saviours, a small but dangerous gang operating out of Salts End, one of the rougher districts in Zadaar. Mr. Silver, catching Nora red handed decided that she had potential and took her under his wing. The next few years were spent under his tutelage honing her thieving skills and acting as a runner for the Saviours. She became more and more involved in the shadowy world of the criminal underground and found herself, for the first time, not just surviving but thriving. She may have made her way to the top of the ladder had she remained but alas, it wasn't to be.
         </p>
         <div class="h3">A Dashing Soldier</div>
         <p>
            Nora met Jiarvden in the worst possible way. Mr. Silver had him tied up in the basement of the Saints headquarters and was torturing him for information. Nora being his current favourite was called in to learn how to properly "extract information". It was the wrong decision. Nora found the experience horrifying and with every passing moment, every new pain inflicted, every anguished wail her cold heart broke. Eventually Mr. Silver finished his cruel ministrations and he finally noticed the tears on Nora's face. "You have to be better than this. Stronger." he instructed her to "take care" of the poor man and left her to it. Another mistake on his part. Nora freed the man and snuck him out of the Saviours' hideout and took him to a temple of Avandra for healing. She should have just left him there but something stopped her and she looked up and saw the serene face of the Changebringer staring down at her. She stayed with him and vowed to take care of him for the rest of her life. She managed to keep that vow for the rest of his life.
         </p>
         <div class="h3">A Mother, a Widow, and a Nurse</div>
         <p>
            After recovering Jiarvden, with Nora fussing at his side made a report to his commanding officer with Nora as a witness. The Captain began to plot the destruction of the Saviours but before charged Jiarvden with Nora's safety and sent them away. Nora didn't really think too much about her old gang after that. They were based in Zadaar and she was off to new places with her handsome new companion. They travelled far and wide,  with every new posting Jiarvden received and Nora began her training as a nurse. Eventually the two fell in love, got married and not too long after they found themselves the new parents of an orphan elven boy. Jonathon drew the couple even closer and fow a few years everything was perfect. It was Mr. Wolf that found them. He was known for holding grudges and he had never forgiven Nora for leaving like she did. He killed Jiarvden slowly, tortured him in front of Nora. She had no doubt that he'd have done the same to Jonathon had he not been chased off by a group of soldiers, drawn by the sounds of screaming. Nora was never the same after that. She withdrew from her work as a medic moving to a small town and working as a healer. She kept Jonathon close, constantly watching him and laying so many rules on him that as he got older they started to contradict each other. As a teenager he began to pull away and as a result she desperately tried to hold on tighter.
         </p>
         <div class="h3">The Falling Out</div>
         <p>
            It was too much in the end. Jonathon, once a sweet boy who loved his mother more than anything, became a man suffocated by her constant fretting. He told her that he planned to head to the nearest city, Darrington and enlist in the army. She did not take it well. The argument devolved into screaming, and then into pleading and begging. By the end of it Jonathon packed his things and left and there was nothing Nora could do to stop him. Weeks later, once Nora had properly calmed down she began to write letters to Jonathon and after months of silence she decided to follow him. She couldn't find him in Darrington. Nor in the next few towns she came too. Concern and worry became panic and terror as she began to frantically look for her son. It broke something in her. She was eventually taken in by some clerics though she couldn't tell you which deity they worshipped, or even what town or city the mental hospital was in. Her days were spent talking about her brave little soldier to whoever would listen, and her nights were spent sobbing in her bed even though she didn't know why. Years flew by in a daze as Nora's mind collapsed under the weight of guilt and fear and desperately tried to construct a sweeter reality to protect her from herself.
         </p>
         <div class="h3">One Last Little Trip</div>
         <p>
            Lucidity began to intrude on her little fantasy. Bit by bit she began to come back to herself, though she couldn't say what caused it. The clerics were baffled but when she asked to leave they couldn't find a reason to stop her. Nora went back out into the world an old woman and decided that she was going on one final trip. No destination, no plan. Life had always thrown her curveballs so she decided that this time, she was going to roll with the punches. She chose a direction and walked. When a wagon stopped to offer her a ride she accepted without hesitation. When she was presented with an opportunity to liberate some bastard of their coins she took it. When she met a weird guy who insisted that his name was Jeff before making shifty eyes she immediately decided to travel with him. All the while she kept up the fiction of her brave son, a soldier, who would write to her when he had the time. It didn't help that she was prone to spells of forgetfulness so more often than not she believes the lie she tells to herself and to others.

         <div class="h3">Stuff for the Future</div>
         <p>
            I'm still not quite sure how she ended up in Creswell outside of Angela's house but i think we hinted at being hired by an anonymous third party to find someone, if thats super important i can hash it out but basically Nora couldn't care less about that anymore. She is living for the hell of it, seeking out risky situations, strange people and anything that seems even remotely interesting or fun. She struggles to form any real attachments but will default to a motherly attitude and demeanor when she isn't doing something insane. She won't outright betray people but she will take advantage of people if she thinks it will be interesting. That being said if anything regarding Jonathon or the Saviours comes into her life there's no telling what she will or won't do. Deep down under all of the crazy, she wants revenge and to find her boy but that stuff is hella buried. All she knows is that a) she is on one last little trip, b) that the trip ends when her life does, c) if she ever finds Mr. wolf she is going to skin him alive and lastly, that Jonathon will write to her when he has time.
