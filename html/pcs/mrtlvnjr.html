         <h2>Backstory</h2>
         <p>
            Mrtlvnjr Keythel was raised in Cornira, a township on Blackpool Bay, just north of the mountain ranges, population around 400. Sitting at the flashpoint between a forest, a mountain range and a bay, the town at one point was a relatively flourishing economy for the town's size, with a wide range of goods harvested and processed.
         </p>
         <p>
            As Mrtlvnjr's human mother was a worker on a fishing vessel, she would spend the majority of the year anchored out beyond the bay, leaving Mrtlvnjr to largely be raised by his elf father alongside his older brother, Crmltn, both of whom were harvesters in the nearby forests. Mrtlvnjr initially followed in their footsteps, spending a handful of summers joining them at peak foraging season, and then eventually joining them full-time in the field.
         </p>
         <p>
            Mrtlvnjr and Crmltn were one of only a handful of half-elves to live in Crenel, with the majority of the population (around 70%) being made up of dwarves who worked in the mines of the mountain ranges, with the remainder of the population being largely elves and a scattering of humans who worked the forests or domestic roles in the township. As such, growing up around a large group of boisterous working-class dwarves naturally influenced the way Mrtlvnjr acts, not least of which is his relative lack of volume control, a trait which could be seen in Crmltn also.
         </p>
         <p>
            Being near a mountain range, winters were particularly harsh. The town took this in their stride, however, with some dwarves choosing to move from mine work to forestry as the weather got harsher and the mines in the mountains became more dangerous, although the more fool-hardy would stay put in the mines year-round, believing the minerals to be strengthened by the conditions. Winters were also the only lengthened periods of time Mrtlvnjr would get to spend with his mother, as the bay had a tendency to freeze over and make the outer seas too rough for commercial ventures.
         </p>
         <p>
            The town would always be relatively prepared for sudden blizzards or cold snaps as the miners who remained on the mountains would remain in regular contact regarding incoming weather. However, one year in the middle of autumn, well before the expected period for blizzards, a storm stronger than any they had ever experienced before rushed through the township. As there was no active weather watch taking place, the storm that swept through on this autumn morning was devastating, causing significant avalanches on the mountains and burying homes in the snow. The forestry workers, who were already out in the field by this point, thought the cold weather unusual given the season, but were sheltered enough that they didn't feel the brunt of the storm. It was only when the crashing of the waves of snow on to the town echoed through the trees that they realised something was wrong. Upon arrival, they found most of their homes buried, only the top floors of communal buildings like the tavern and the general store indicating there was ever anything there. As the majority of the workers from the forest scrambled to what was left of their homes to dig out their remaining family, Mrtlvnjr and his father and brother, being lucky to have their family's lives intact, turned their concern to the dwarves stuck up in the mines. Despite their relative inexperience with scaling mountains, they could see the main mine hatch from their home and knew what area to search. After immediately scrambling up the mountain, they started digging with their hands before realising how little progress they were making. They were soon joined by some more of their fellow forester scavengers, but again, there was only so much they could do with their hands. With the town in a state of panic, Mrtlvnjr's father took the lead in coordinating a rescue effort amongst the workers who were left. Following a concerted effort by the whole team to secure loose snow above the mine shaft and as many people digging through as they could, three long days of work and they finally breached the entry to the mine where, by some sheer miracle, all the miners had survived with just a few cases of frostbite and some hunger.
         </p>
         <p>
            As the rest of the town reconciled and the news was broken to the miners about the town and the loved ones who ended up buried, Mrtlvnjr was overwhelmed with wonder about Auril, the goddess of winter, and why such a deity normally associated with punishing storms would spare such a large number of the townsfolk during this catastrophic incident.
         </p>
         <p>
            Following the mass burials and remembrance services for those who died, much of the town's population decided to move with what was left of their families to other areas where they weren't so vulnerable, many of them to Highgate so they could continue in the mountains. Some of the forestry workers attempted to rebuild what was left of the town, but it never quite thrived the way it once did, with more and more trips to Trottsville being required to restock.
         </p>
         <p>
            Mrtlvnjr, meanwhile, turned his concern to his mother who was still out at sea. He didn't suspect that she had been caught up in the storm, but the severity of it caused the Bay to freeze over at a much greater depth than he had ever seen before. The family and a few others who had loved ones at sea stayed put in the hopes that they would return, but as autumn gave way to winter, it became clear that this bay was not going to defrost and their loved ones wouldn't be returning any time soon. Eventually, more and more families gave up hope and moved away, but Mrtlvnjr, more attached to and seemingly compelled by Auril than ever, believed that the mercy he saw in his town must have carried over to his mother's ship, and that they must be stranded somewhere out past the coast. He knew that their general sailing route had them fishing on their way to Tamworth Bay, before hastily returning home, so the ship must be somewhere off the Malva Coast. With that, he farewelled his father and brother, who went to find another forest town further north for the remainder of the season in hopes of continuing to find work, and Mrtlvnjr set off for Creswell, which he hoped would be his best chance of sourcing information about where this ship might be.
         </p>
         <p>
            On his travels, as he passed through Highgate, he came across a winter solstice festival which the city holds annually as both a celebration and a means of making an offering to Auril during her harshest season. Since Mrtlvnjr also knew many of the dwarf families from Cornira had taken up residence in Highgate, he took this time to reconnect both with friends from his past and with the deity which he had grown such a strong devotion towards. He met with an elder of the temple of Auril in Highgate named Darson. Darson felt an innate spiritual connection with Mrtlvnjr, recognising the tribulations in his past, and offered to pray and study with him during the Solstice, eventually resulting in Mrtlvnjr partaking in the annual human sacrifice made to Auril as an offering of security through the coldest months. This deep connection both with community and with the deity herself enlightened Mrtlvnjr's strengths and skills in the distribution of life, which he would find himself using to a significant degree during his travels. Following the Solstice, Mrtlvnjr headed south along the coast, aiming to visit port towns and villages along the way in search of more information. He worked his way to Fleydire, spending an additional four nights there as he investigated the townsfolk and those who may have interacted with his mother's ship. There, he discovered that they had also had ships disappear around the same time as the pre-season storm, with only a handful returning ever since, and those indicated they were further out in the sea, away from the landfall of the snowstorm. Some of the citizens also indicated that they remembered seeing the Cornira ship dock on their way further along the coast, though that was many months ago by this stage.
         </p>
         <p>
            Following this, Mrtlvnjr made a bee-line for Creswell. He attempted to remain along the coast past the forest, but the density of the wood along the main path made traversal difficult, and with no major snowfall and his understanding of Auril's power and presence still in its early stages, he was unable to navigate further out of the forest to visit any small coastal regions, so he was forced to stay the path through the forest to Creswell. Upon arrival in Creswell, he undertook much of the same path as in Fleydire, interviewing townsfolk and investigating the impacts of the storm on the town. He found that, once again, Fleydire had had ships go missing as well, but in this case, none of the eight ships they lost, accounting for around 60 people, had yet to return. Mrtlvnjr took this to mean that either all ships have been caught in the same area, or the storm had an even wider reach than he anticipated to the east of the region. He intended to continue his trek along the coast after spending five nights in Creswell, however, with the Last Storm inbound and now being aware of the devastation and harshness of this particular storm season, he decided to wait it out in Creswell, splitting his time between talking to the dock workers drinking in the Tipsy Keg, and taking in the entertainment at the Fighting Pits, at which point he meets with those who would now become his current party.
