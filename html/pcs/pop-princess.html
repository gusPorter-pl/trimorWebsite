         Mawai's biggest abandoned building - in the pine forest - but the pines are REALLY big like skyscraper big even thought the animals are really small (this is so all the orphans could be strapped onto a pine later on when Pop Princess "dies")
         I had 6 best friends - Tok, Phig, Munty, Blueg, Norman and Earring.
         Tok - had very weak arms - so very useful with his mind - taught Pop Princess a lot about boardgames, chess and gambling type of jazz. Tok was a fucking genius. But never ask Tok to duel in an arm wrestle. That's just offensive.
         Phig kept me alive because Phig was a pig who knew where all the nutritional food is at. Unfortunately phig was allergic to a lot of food. Was severely sick all the time.
         Munty had been bullied very intensely during his time in the orphanage. You see, Munty has perfect complexion, beautiful purple eyes, silky white hair. But his chin was the size of his own head. Kids would tease Munty for his deformities, but I thought he was beautiful.
         Blueg, now how could someone be a human, but have the complexion of the ocean? Yes, Blueg was blue, almost turquoise. But that was the only part that set him apart from other humans (water genesai)
         Norman was pretty average, apart from that his beard started to grow at the age of 7, before his untimely death his beard was big and bushy. He had the best sense of humour.
         Earring had extra fingers on each finger (10 fingers on each hand), completely hairless -->
         
         <!-- THE TIEFLING BARD CURSE

         My enemy is 

         Sir Dame Lucia'Ric pickle fa Morphi But really, he's Phig!

         The secret is, the gift of being a tiefling bard comes at a deadly price. You see, being a tiefling bard you have an addiction to impulsive behaviours. If you are battled by another impulsive tiefling, they have the power to steal your soul as the ultimate death weapon.

         Sir Dame Lucia'Ric pickle fa Morphi, was never a human, but another tiefling who knows this secret, and pop princess was his lover. The biggest betrayal was not only did he try to kill her. But he wanted to possess the powers to murder anyone he wishes!

         Pop princess is running from the Dame, not only to protect the world from him, but if poppy was to win a battle with the Dame, SHE TO CAN MURDER ANYONE SHE PLEASES


         She's not only impulsive, but what if her impulsives her head came to life?

         Part of the curse of her resurrection is that Pop Princess is most pure when she is naive of everything, the more she finds out about her past life, the more Pop Princess will be influenced to pure chaotic evil. If you think of the chaotic scale, pop princess starts off as chaotic good, then the more she discovers, neutral. Then if she fully remembers everything, it's all chaotic evil. It won't be long until evidence of the history or her, the Mawai islands would be revealed. Pop Princess could be the most evil character the team could encounter. -->

         <h2>Backstory</h2>
         <div class="h3">Mawai - A Land Thought Inhabitable</div>
         <p>
            The invasion is believed to have started with the Creswell people learning about the small horses and goats. How could agriculture animals be so small? The Creswell people believed they must taxidermy the animals to prove not only their existence, but to profit on their discoveries.
         </p>
         <p>
            When the Mawai people found the Creswell people slaughtering their sacred tiny animals, the betrayal impacted them so deeply that there was an immediate war. The war was so violent, so chaotic, and yet it was clear that the Creswell brigade were slaughtering them with ease.
         </p>
         <p>
            The arrangement with the Creswell people to end their torture was to ship them their agricultural goods free of charge. The demand was too high and to keep peace, the Mawai people were left to starve with only small remains of food sources. Another problem was the overpopulation of children born from the rapes of their invasions. Mawai was once a paradise, now a poverty stricken island under the fear of the colonisers, the Creswell brigade.

            I am Pop Princess. A demon who is obsessed with big dicks and big beats, but I wasn't always like this. I grew up in an orphanage, with my family of bastards.
         </p>
         <p>
            Pop Princess was originally named Kitchie, she was the most bland and average child in the orphanage. When Kitchie was born, she was taken immediately into watch with the orphanages special doctors unit. However due to being completely lacking in any resources, her simple sickness would never heal until she was fed by Phig. Constantly malnourished until Phig took pity on Kitchie by feeding her nourishing grains that help gain weight. He found her when he was rushed into the unit by eating a berry. Never had he seen a child his age look so sad, sickly, and lonely. When Kitchie gained enough strength to walk, Phig took her and introduced her to his bandit friends. Kitchie had straw hair, very thin and brittle, no strength, inflamed gums and brown teeth.

            I guess during the invasion of Mawai islands, all our village women were raped by your so-called heroes that re-bordered our islands to be the trisolas, further separating us from our holy temples and leaving an overflow of children that couldn't be loved. In order to appease the gods as a compromise for not being among the temples (well, this is information I was told before my departure from my human body) my orphanage was chosen by the trisola government as a mass execution by the time I was 14. They were gonna kill the orphans.
         </p>
         <div class="h3">Sacrificed</div>
         <p>
            I don't remember my journey to the main land. All I remember is being exposed on the coast, ready to die, being prepared for the 'sacrificial ceremony', tied up to a raft with my 5000 or so fellow orphan siblings, then being pushed into the ocean. I was blind folded so I wouldn't know if I was tied up with my 6 best friends.
         </p>
         <p>
            Somehow I woke up. I don't even remember drowning, I don't think I drowned. Instead I experienced visions of strange lands. Mass of people while being on a large pedestal, with the smell of human sweat and something toxic that was embraced. My body was carried by a rhythm that I could only assume were waves, but in my memory it was a technology; a magic pulsed into song. The song would morph my mind into montages of different environments.
         </p>
         <p>
            When I woke up on the coast, I was in a different body with no memory of what I looked like in the last one. Pop Princess was my title that came with these visions, as I don't remember my original name.
         </p>
         <p>
            Was it luck that the closest gathering of a society that I woke up next to was the 'Shelly shore side Creswell daily festival'? Or was it Milils that brought me to the festival?
         </p>
         <div class="h3">The Becoming of a Bard</div>
         <p>
            The moment my eyes started to peel back from the recovery of being in the ocean for however long I was there, there was a frenzy of people running towards me. My senses were hazy, there was an exclamation of a crowd chanting 'Teifling!' And 'Milil praise us a performance'. Next thing I knew, I was lifted by the crowd and brought to a stage in the middle of a bustling market. With very little idea on what was going on, all I could do was sway my limbs, make noises and show off my remarkable flexibility.
         </p>
         <p>
            When the show ended, I was able to understand a little bit more of my surroundings. The scene was bustling, heavily industrial, right near the Creswell port mixed with every industry competing for attention from travelers and investors.
         </p>
         <p>
            The Creswell Commercial Port (better known as 'The Tipsy Sea Serpent') is one the busiest foot-trafficked areas in Creswell. To occupy the heavy amount of industry demand, the Port is sectioned into a jungle of bridges, stairways, pathways that lead up to 45 stories. It has been rumored that since the development of the commercial port, there has been 460 missing children averaged a year due to highly complex structure.
         </p>
         <p>
            I shared the stage with 5 other humans, the same ones who scooped me from the sand onto the stage. There was Knidai, a small acrobatic human boy who wore patches of random fabrics, stitched together at random. Goraa, the strength attraction of the show was 2 metres tall, covered in every variation of snake tattoos, larger and more intimidating that any human I've ever had seen. Veetaaä was a young beautiful woman with long white hair and striking gray eyes, who always wore the same black linen gown. Veetaaä may have been a half-elf, I only assumed because although she was a very standard looking human, she looked far too young for the amount of stories she had experienced. Corman was the illusionist, although elderly he was healthier and more agile than the lot, and they were an extremely athletic crew. Last was the manager of the crew, but as well, he was the head merchant of the entire Creswell market. Sir Dame Lucia'Ric Pickle fa Morphi. Although the height and the features of a regular human, Lucia had neon green skin, which was strange for someone who claimed to be born from Creswell, although he said.
         </p>
         <p>
            Sir Dame Lucia'Ric Pickle fa Morphi greeted me by claiming it was him who spotted me on the shore and knew from a distance I was a tiefling, with great mystical powers that would help the Creswell markets flourish. Lucia then took me in his arms, only to then teach me the ways of understanding the market of performance, how his small group of bandits were the selling pitch of the Creswell markets and why his promotion to head merchant didn't deter him from his performing family. The generosity of this mysterious green man made me fall more for him each day, throughout my five year career of being his main attraction of the shows.
         </p>
         <div class="h3">A Dark Secret</div>
         <p>
            It all came to a horrific halt when we were making sweet sweet love, like we did every night. But what made this night so different was that instead of climaxing, he stopped, looked at me, and his eyes were black. He then spoke in an unfamiliar voice "from the sea you came, 15 years after you died". Those words shook me in an uncontrollable spasm that shoved him off my body. To that he grinned, "to think I am human is ignorant, for I am..."
         </p>
         <p>
            It was at that point I interrupted him by throwing a candle at him, jumped out of the window and ran out of the tavern, and ran through crowds of pissed humans. Through the small window he then attempted to aim arrows at me, I was followed by death as he missed and hit innocent civilians. Luckily I escaped, I haven't seen him and my allies since that fateful night. I only survived off featuring in smaller venues, but could never stay long in case he got word of my whereabouts. And that leads us to the present, of drinking in a stadium and being caught up in this new wild adventure.
         </p>
         <p>
            It's been 5 years in this body, I don't exactly know why I'm alive, why I'm magical, or why I'm hyper sexualised with big tiddies, a huge cock, or a crazy slippery puss. However it's given me huge success in the entertainment industry, and I'm not complaining. My entertainment companions have been my support and my allies. I've met and loved many souls on this journey to Creswell.
         </p>
         <p>
            Many of these connections have been fulfilling, however I am still yet to find a body with the mind of a sacrificed orphan from the Mawai islands. My allies, anyone who is an outcast, bastards, those who grew up like me with no one who loved them, yet our connections are. Maybe I'm looking for my siblings who were tied on the same pine that was pushed into the ocean. Who knows. I'm yet to find a single lost child.
         </p>
         <p>
            I don't trust nobody who dictates big life changing decisions for those who aren't capable of power. I believe those who rules and commands are following an evil passage of corruption and violence. I've experienced misery and pain in my travels and my past life, and all I can tell you is that those who believe they are pure, wise, and mighty are those with the blackest of hearts.
         </p>
         <p>
            My desire is not just of the biggest dick, but also the sweetest revenge is sucking the evil out of humanity. I'll find a way. In due coursetime.
