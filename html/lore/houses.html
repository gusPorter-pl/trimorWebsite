         <h2>House Grian/Zindradir</h2>
         <p>
            House Grian comes from one of the oldest families in Trimor, House Zindradir. In the 2nd era members of the Zindradir family bore matching birth marks that were eventually adapted into their house crest.
         </p>
         <p>
            During the war against the fiend invasion a portal opened on the kingdom of Endes, all but confirming its destruction. Being a warrior kingdom, their King Tanval Zindradir and a small elite force stayed to fight the fiends and gave the Endesine people a chance to escape with his son and Prince Nohrelg-rian Zindradir leading them. After a few years roaming the lands with Nohrelg-rian as their new king, the Endisine had basically become a mobile army kingdom, fighting back fiends where they found them but not becoming tied to a specific place, or striking any significant damage against the fiends. Though they were surviving, and somewhat thriving by scavenging others' battlegrounds, they realized this scourge was not going away as things were.
         </p>
         <p>
            Eventually they joined the alliance and contributed considerable forces to the Crimson Malitia in a pivotal moment of the war against the fiends. Without their aid it was likely that Creswell would have fallen, especially because it was discovered that the Endesine people (especially the Zindradir line) seemed to have some sort of resistance to fiends and their magic.
         </p>
         <p>
            Once the war was over life began returning to normal. Many kingdoms who joined the alliance were glorified in festivals and celebrations following the war, but the crucial achievements of the Endisine were strangely absent or underplayed. Although the family heads had become close as allies and friends during the war, Norlock Starr had been advised that his family should take most of the credit as they were to head the united monarchy moving forward. Dividing accolades too much would cause confusion and split allegiances among the people. Because the Endisine were such a formidable fighting power (although considerably more formidable before the heavy casualties during the last battle) it was feared giving them too much adoration in the eyes of the masses might lead to a large amount of the surviving population opting to follow them instead.
         </p>
         <p>
            Furious that their brave warriors, both living and dead, were being disrespected after such a great sacrifice, Nohrelg-rian decided that they wanted no part of the new monarchy. With their previous kingdom of Endes now lying in ruin, and having become accustomed to the nomadic lifestyle during the war, they instead became a wandering kingdom. To mark a fresh start and sever the ties to the their part in allying with the ungrateful Starr family, Nohrelg-rian Zindradir changed his name to Grian, first of his name. With no strict allegiance to the Starr monarchy, nor any real antagonism toward them, the now much dwindled Endisine wander the lands, a shadow of their former selves.

            Historians (and largely they themselves) mostly do not remember their sacrifices and they have become somewhat unpopular, being seen more as a large group of marauders than a once noble kingdom as time passes. Eventually they adopt the name Dread Maw and embrace their rejection. Most of this history is forgotten or covered up to keep the Starr monarchy as strong as possible, but there would be some knowledge of the truth known to trusted historians in Billingwood and potentially some of those in Dread Maw. The first offspring of Grian did not bare the same birth mark that his father and previous generations shared, but it would reappear from time to time down the bloodline as a small reminder of their lineage.
