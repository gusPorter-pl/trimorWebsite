            There are prominent forts located by the two bridges entering the city, who occasionally establish random checkpoints. There are other watch sites along the road beyond the town borders, that keep an eye on traffic. Fleydire provides some support to the village Kengruun, that is located to the east.

         <h3>Industry</h3>
         <p>
            Tourism produces a fair share of revenue for workers, so tax money allows for the upkeep of defences, equipment of Starrgard, and roads. This also means there are a variety of inns and taverns of all classes. Crops are imported from Kengruun, a village to the east on the road to Creswell. Other foods such as meats, fish, and fruits are hunted and gathered from nearby, which can be found at various stalls in the markets.
