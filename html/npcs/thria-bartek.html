            General Commander Thria Bartek is the highest ranked officer in the Crinegard Plains. She is just shy of 5 feet tall, and has braided, short, blonde hair, with dark blue eyes. She has an expecting voice, and has a raised eyebrow when waiting for someone to finish speaking.

            The General Commander has run Creswell for the past 20 years. She has kept the city in order throughout her time at the top, with no question of her position being asked. However, it hasn't been easy running the regional capital of the Crinegard Plains. Over the past 10 years, budget cut after budget cut has put a strain in how the Starrgard and Crimson Malitia operate under her order. She finds there is little respect for the southern regions from the King. This is also shown from the grossly high taxes being put on imports and exports processed through the Trade Guild, with little of it being kept for the Plains' use.

            Over the past two years, Bartek has had enough. She has got together a group of individuals, and formed a group known as the
