         <p>
            Mahana joined the Arcane Conglomerate in 3E-266, after discovering an in-born ability to control the weave. She made friends with 
            <span class="link"><a href="./bill-and-billie-osbul.html">Bill and Billie Osbul</a></span>, and 
            <span class="link"><a href="./sulqrin.html">Sulqrin</a></span>. This group stuck together through their studies at the school, and worked on a research project that would have been a game-changing advancement in the school of evocation. However, after Billie's discovery of Vice-Arch Mage 
            <span class="link"><a href="./isolna-davaris.html">Isolna Davaris</a></span>'s plan to use their findings for her own benefit, they escaped the school the night before their presentation, taking their research with them. They met up with a contact of Mahana, named           
            <span class="link"><a href="./crela.html">Crela</a></span>. They split up that night, and Mahana headed north into the Dire Alps, where she has found herself ever since.
