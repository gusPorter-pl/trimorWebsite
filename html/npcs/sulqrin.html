            A male black dragonborn wizard, Sulqrin stands 6'2" tall. With a deep voice, he is able to convey conversation well, and has a deep understanding of many things arcane.

         <h3><a href="../organisations/arcane-conglomerate.html">The Arcane Conglomerate</a></h3>
         <p>
            Sulqrin began his studies as a talented wizard at the Arcane Conglomerate, alongside 
            <span class="link"><a href="./bill-and-billie-osbul.html">Bill, Billie</a></span> and
            <span class="link"><a href="./mahana.html">Mahana</a></span>. They made a potent team, and carried out research together in what would be their final year at the Conglomerate. This was before they went their separate ways after they found out how 
            <span class="link"><a href="./isolna-davaris.html">Isolna Davaris</a></span>, their supervisor, was going to use their research.
         </p>
         <h3>A Mage in Distant Lands</h3>
         <p>
            Sulqrin did not want to travel too far from 
            <span class="link"><a href="../settlements/zadaar.html">Zadaar</a></span>, as he had never travelled far before, but realised that he would need to disguise himself. He packed his transmuters ring that he came up with for a project just for this, and finds himself portrayed as a Ludaarian Human named Obeth. He finds himself in 
            <span class="link"><a href="../settlements/carwright.html">Carwright</a></span>, working as an enchanter for one of the mages there. The old saying goes that hard work pays off, and this is why Sulqrin now finds himself as the Arcanist Advisor on the Lurian Council.
