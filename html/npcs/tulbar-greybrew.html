				Tulbar Greybrew runs Greybrew's Potion Store in 
				<span class="link"><a href="../settlements/buldaar.html">Buldaar</a></span>, located in the central town square. Tulbar and his wife Gaeden opened this shop 200 years ago after they moved away 
				<span class="link"><a href="../settlements/duffledon.html">Duffledon</a></span>, after a terrible disease plagued the crops they would use for potion making. Tulbar's sister took him in, and they opened a small stall in the markets where they would sell herbal remidies and creams. An individual took interest in Tulbar's alcehmical skills, and gave him a sizeable amount of gold in exchange for some complex potions. With this money, they could afford to open up a shop in the central town square that would later become Greybrew's. The Crown and the Argent Axes took interest in his skills, and he has potions commissioned to this day to help their efforts.

				Tulbar and Gaeden had three sons, Alton, Lorig, and Piker (deceased) Greybrew. Alton and Lorig have now carried on the family business to other neighbouring towns, whereas Piker hung around. Piker was more skilled with fighting than alchemy, so he became a part of the adventuring guild. He had blond hair. He carried with him a couple of shortswords and a pendant around his neck. "If your brother liked wheelbarrows, he died doing what he loved." They also had a daughter,
