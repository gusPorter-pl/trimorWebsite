            Isolna Davaris is the Vice-Arch Mage of the 
            <span class="link"><a href="../organisations/arcane-conglomerate.html">Arcane Conglomerate</a></span>, and the head of its School of Evocation. She is a high elven woman, about 5'8". She has long golden-blonde hair that is worn out at all times.
         </p>
         <h3>Background at the Arcane Conglomerate</h3>
         <p>
            She studied at the school for 10 years, before becoming one of the top researchers of the Conglomerate. She has been on the advisory board for the past 55 years, only achieving her current title of Vice-Arch Mage 25 years ago, during the Enlightening in 3E-261.

         <h3>The Eldrith Cannon Project</h3>
         <p>
            During the summer of 3E-269, 
            <span class="link"><a href="./bill-and-billie-osbul.html">Bill, Billie</a></span>, 
            <span class="link"><a href="./sulqrin.html">Sulqrin</a></span> and
            <span class="link"><a href="./mahana.html">Mahana</a></span> began their year-long project into researching and designing a method of storing evocational energy, and using it for cannons that could be used to defend settlements from attacks and raids. Isolna thought this was a fantastic project to work on, and suggested that she supervise it.
         </p>
         <p>
            The project had lots of promise to it, and the progress that was being made was advancement that was yet to be seen down any school's history. Isolna envisioned other possible uses to the research that was being undertaken. She asked the group to pursue these, as she could see them being incredibly benefitial for the school and even the nation. However, these ideas were not what the group envisioned about their research. She was incredibly insistent about this, but the group refused, and kept to their scope.
         </p>
         <p>
            This frustrated Isolna, so she used their findings to conduct her own research. It had as much progress as it could have, with just her working on it. Her plan was to present her ideas to the Arch Mage of the Conglomerate after the group had their final presentation during The Enlightening in 3E-270. However, on the day of The Enlightening, the group vanished with no trace. Their findings and research were taken, and divination proved unsuccessful in locating them.
