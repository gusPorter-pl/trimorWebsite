            Pod is a long retired adventurer who settled down in Muldire for some reason. He is an older gnome who helped out 
            <span class="link"><a href="./bill-and-billie-osbul.html">Bill and Billie</a></span> settle down into a quieter part of Muldire.

         <h3>A Helper to the Needy</h3>
         <p>
            Pod lived a adventrous life that protected many. He quickly grew the ability to notice those in need, and also how to respond to those who needed help. This is why when Bill and Billie Osbul came to town, he knew they his support. He got them settled down into a more quiet part in Fleydire, and helped out even more when Bill and Billie had twin sons.

            It was Pod's responsibility to look after Bizzie and Lizzie after Bill and Billie's passing, and he had clear instructions on how to look after them, but no one could have predicted what would happen next. He did all he could, and hopes that Bizzie and Lizzie are now on the right path to find out what really happened to their parents all those years ago.
