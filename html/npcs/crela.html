         <h3>Mahana, the Saviour</h3>
         <p>
            One day Crela was manning a stall in the markets when someone knicked a coin purse at the side of the store and ran off. 
            <span class="link"><a href="./mahana.html">Mahana</a></span> was there to trip up the petty thief. The town guard took the thief away, while Crela thanked Mahana for her bravery. She said that if there was anything she could do for her she would be grateful. Mahana thought nothing of it, thanked her, and walked away with some baked goods, thinking that she would never she this woman again.

         <h3>Bizzie's Connection</h3>
         <p>
            Bill and Billie told 
            <span class="link"><a href="./pod.html">Pod</a></span> to tell their kids that if anything ever happened to them, they should head to see Crela to learn what really happened to them. Crela would be very happy to share her wisdom and knowledge if Bizzie showed her his amulet.
