            Arinis Morsys is a witch that resides in Dresden, a small fishing village an hour south of 
            <span class="link"><a href="../settlements/muldire.html">Muldire</a></span>. It was in her hut where she transformed Lizzie, Bizzie's brother, into a giant lizard.

         <h3>Family Matters</h3>
         <p>
            She has a nephew named Gregor, who was Lizzie's best friend. He is the one who got Lizzie addicted to the lizard venom that she produced. One day, Lizzie became so dependent on it, that he signed a deal with Arinis that he did not read, which transferred his soul into the body of this giant lizard.
