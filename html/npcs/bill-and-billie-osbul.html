            Bill and Bilie were two halflings who met in 
            <span class="link"><a href="../settlements/zadaar.html">Zadaar</a></span>.
         </p>
         <h3>Study in the Arcane</h3>
         <p>
            They met in the dorms of the  
            <span class="link"><a href="../organisations/arcane-conglomerate.html">Arcane Conglomerate</a></span> in 3E-266, two weeks before classes started for the Autumn. Bill took a nack in the evocation school, whereas Billie found that she had an affinity with creating, and engineering, so went down the path to become a talented artificer.
         </p>
         <p>
            After three years of study, Bill and Billie, alongside
            <span class="link"><a href="./sulqrin.html">Sulqrin</a></span>, a Dragonborn Wizard, and 
            <span class="link"><a href="./mahana.html">Mahana</a></span>, a Half-Elf Sorcerer, took part in a summer research project as a part of the Arcane Conglomerate's program. They choose to study how evocation could be used to defend settlements and structures by storing the energy, and using it against those who come to attack.

         <h3>A Secret Exposed</h3>
         <p>
            Just as the team is finishing their research at the end of summer, on Morqen 18, 3e-270, Billie discovers that the Vice-Arch Mage 
            <span class="link"><a href="./isolna-davaris.html">Isolna Davaris</a></span> is planning to adapt their research for offensive purposes. They decide that the best course of action is to escape the Arcane Conglomerate, and to take all of their research with them. On Morqen 23, the day before The Enlightening, the day of their big presentation, they flee the campus grounds, but not before breaking into the top floors of the library tower, and stealing 4 purple amulets, to help protect themselves against divination.
         </p>
         <p>
            They get taken in by 
            <span class="link"><a href="./crela.html">Crela</a></span> that night, a friend of Mahana. They do not wait before the sun to rise before escaping the city. They decide it was best they split up. Sulqrin went south, Mahana went North, while Bill and Billie stuck together, and started to head east.
