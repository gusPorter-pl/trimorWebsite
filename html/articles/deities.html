         <h3>Auril, the Frostmaiden</h3>
         <p>
            The winter is harsh for some. Storms and blizzards can wreck havoc on a landscape and take no prisoners. This is the doing of Auril. The goddess of winter does not spare anyone who dares cross her fury. Many pray to halt and lessen the wrath of winter, but those who receive her blessing are not spared the bitter cold, rather are only allowed to endure it.
         </p>
         <h5>Commandments of Auril</h5>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Embrace the cold, and all that is brought with it. It is a natural part of life.
            </li>
            <li>
               Do not succumb to a false sense of security. Danger can strike at any moment.
            </li>
            <li>
               Spread the word of the cold, for it shall come and spare no one.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <h3><a id="avandra">Avandra, the Change Bringer</a></h3>
         <p>
            Those who worship Avandra believe in change, freedom, and luck. Her worship is found among merchants, adventurers, and anyone wishing a change in their way of life, and a direction to follow. Her temples are found in common destinations to travellers, and sometime shrines are set up on the side of well-travelled roads.
         </p>
         <h5>Commandments of Avandra</h5>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Luck favours the bold. Grasp your own fate, and the Change Bringer will be at your back.
            </li>
            <li>
               Change is inevitable, but the righteous make change for the better.
            </li>
            <li>
               Rise against tyranny. Fight for the freedom of yourself and others.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Milil, Guardian of Entertainment</h3>
         <p>
            Even in times of strife, the ballad of a song, or the beauty of a poem can distract the mind for even the smallest time. Milil aims to represent life as a ever-writing ballad, an event in history a verse in a symphony, and a poem shining the light on a kingdom's hard fought victories, and the defeat of its enemies. Many bards and entertainers follow Milil for guidance, and many pay for their ale to share their stories.
         </p>
         <h5>Commandments of Milil</h5>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Inspire others through what you know. A little happiness is sought for everywhere.
            </li>
            <li>
               Spread the truth of the world. A good story is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.
            </li>
            <li>
               Encourage other to explore the arts. Keep history intact for the future generations to come.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Moradin, the Allhammer</h3>
         <p>
            The god of craft and creation is worshiped by smiths, miners, and artisans. The roots of this deity stem from the dwarvish heritage of the Crinegard Plains, and has spread throughout Trimor during the third era. He guides those who forge the greatest of weapons, and some believe he even shaped the mountain line.
         </p>
         <h5>Commandments of Moradin</h5>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Remain stoic and tenacious in the face of catastrophe.
            </li>
            <li>            
               Uphold and promote loyalty to family, loyalty to your friends, and loyalty to your people.
            </li>
            <li>           
               Legacy is paramount. To create something that lasts the ages is to change the world for the better.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Pelor, the Dawn Father</h3>
         <p>
            The Dawn Father looks over fields and shines light to farmers and common folk, as well as paladins and rangers who provide for the needy, and seek the destruction of evil. Pelor watches over the harvest in many settlements, and provides healing to the weak.
         </p>
         <h5>Commandments of Pelor</h5>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Shine the light where darkness dwells, displaying kindness, compassion, and mercy.
            </li>
            <li>           
               Help relieve suffering, wherever you find it.
            </li>
            <li>           
               Be ever vigilant over evil. Those are easy to forget the lessons of the past.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Savras, the All-Seeing</h3>
         <p>
            Many of those who seek greater knowledge or study the ways of the arcane seek the help of Savras. He provides insight to the future, and guides those who worship him to learn from the past. The All-Seeing's main temple is situated in Zadaar, and those who worship him aim to make the trek there once in their lifetime's to see him in all his glory.
         </p>
         <h5>Commandments of Savras</h5>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Share your knowledge with those who seek it. Teaching others in what you have learned can further understanding, rather than letting it die out.
            </li>
            <li>            
               Actively seek out further knowledge. Nothing is ever fully understood.
            </li>
            <li>            
               Show off you work and hold your discoveries at the highest esteem.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Torm, the Ally on the Battlefield</h3>
         <p>
            One of the oldest represented deities in Trimor, Torm is worshiped by members of the Crimson Malitia, and paladins of duty and loyality. The brand of Torm shines bright at any branch or encampment across the kingdom, and the word of his might is shared across the kingdom.
         </p>
         <h5>Commandments of Torm</h5>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Be the champion of the weak and defenceless. Protect those who do not possess the power you wield. Care for the sick and aid the distressed.
            </li>
            <li>           
               Be stern and just in your battles with evil. Make war upon evil without cessation. Let your wrath destroy the wicked.
            </li>
            <li>            
               Serve the common good and the rule of law. Your duties are towards protecting others. Strive to do so by questioning unjust laws, and suggesting improvements.
            </li>
         </ul>
